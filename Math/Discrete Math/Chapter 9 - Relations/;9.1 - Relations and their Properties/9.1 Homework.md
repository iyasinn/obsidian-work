**Forgot (0, 1)**
**BE CAREFUL **

So which numbers are relatively prime
I say GCD of 0 and 1 is 1 since both are divisible by 1 at most. 0 divisible by anything but we do have 1 here. 

f. R = {(1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2)}

So LCM = 2. Smallest number they both go into should be 2 straight away 
0 doesn’t go into any number

Not symmetric
Not antisymmetric

**Generally you should give proof as to why this is transitive**


# 4


# 5

**REFLEXIVITY REQUIRES ALL ELEMENTS TO HAVE THE PROPERTY…WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE IN R AS A RELATION. VERY VERY IMPORTANT**
**So for reflexivity try to make sure you consider cases that aren’t in the relation or might not be….since if they actually aren’t in the relation….that’s wrong**

(a, b) in R 
R is the set of all web pages

a. 
Everyone who has visited web page A has also visited web page B

Reflexive: Yes, every web page in R and even if no one visits this is still a rule. 
Symmetric: No
Antisymmetric: No
Transitive: Yes


b.
if (a, b) in R
There are no common links found on both web page a and web page b 

Reflexive: No, there are common links…..well….some web pages might have no links, so (a, a) in R…but some will….so it can’t be reflexive overall. 

Symmetric: Yes

Antisymmetric: No 

Transitive: No
a could have some links that the third page has 


c. 
aRb iff there is at least one common link on web page a and web page b

So need at LEAST one common line

Reflexive: No
If a has no links, then this is instantly false as aRa won’t be in the relation but it should be. So we have found a counterexample.
Not refelxive


Symmetric: Yes
If aRb, then bRa? 
Yes


Antisymmetric: No 

Transitive: No
Easy counterexamples possible


d. 
(a,b) in R if there is a web page that inclues both links to web page a and web page b
So some web page must exist

So (a,a)? 
If a web page does exist that links to a, this is true
But if no web page exists, then this is false and not in the relation. And we can’t guarantee some web page that links to a exists. So **not refleixve** (we will have some points with no relation)




Symmetric: Yes

Antisymmetric: No

Transitive: No


aRb and bRc    so    aRc

What if it’s a different web page linking aRb and bRc….then aRc is false

**hard questions**

R on set of all integers
(x, y) in R iff


a. x != y
Reflexive: No
Symmetric: Yes
Antisymmetric: No
Transitive: No
2R3 ^ 3R2 → 2R2 
No, since 2 = 2

**Be very very careful with edge cases**

b.  xy > 1

Reflexive: No
(0, 0) not in the relation, nor is (1, 1) or (-1, -1)

Symemtric: Yes

Antisymmetric: No

Transitive: Yes

iF we start with positive, then positive x positive > 1, and then that second positivie mathces iwth another positive. It will work out
**We can do a proof by cases here, since a,b both positive or a,b both negative, and so with some c we can definitely have transitivity**




c. x = y + 1     or    x =   y -   1

Reflexive: No   (1, 1) not in this 

Symmetric: yes

**mathematically checking these is fine**
**GOOD, this is a good way to support your claim**

(a, b)
a = b + 1   or   b = a - 1
a = b + 1 or b = a - 1
Flipped


Antisymmetric: No

**Something can’t be both antisymmetric and symmetric if it has elements**

Transitive: No
1R2 and 2R3 does not mean 1R3

**Using the idea that x - y is a multiple of 7 is also good**
**For modulo converting into a moduo form is very useufl**
d. 
x = y mod 7

Reflexive: Yes
Symmetric: Yes
We should prove it
if x = y mod 7
then x = y + 7k
y = x + 7(-k)
y = x mod(7)

Antisymmetric: No

transitive: Yes → congruence sets are consistent
Should still prove this with a proof

x = y + mk
y = z + mn
x = z + mn + mk = z + m(n + k)
x = z mod 7

e. x is a multiple of y

Relfexive: yes, everything is a mutiple of itself
x = x(1)

**0 has some intresting controversey, but it is a multiple of itself at the end of the day (even though it is not a divisor of tiself)**


Symmetric: No
(3, 1) does not mean (1, 3)


**NO** ❌
Antisymmetric: Yes 
If something is a multiple of something else, it is either larger than it or it is the same thing

**NUMBERS DIVIDE THEIR NEGASTIVE COUNTERPARTS AND VICE VERSA**




Transitive: yes

xRy ^ yRz

x = yk
y = zm
x = zmk
x is divisible by z


f.  x < 0 ←> y < 0

Reflexive: yes
Symmetric:  Yes
Antisymmetric: No

Transitive: Yes
**proof by caeses, all must be positive or negative**



g.  x = y^2    for   (x, y)

Reflexie: No
3R3 false

Symmetric: No
1R-1
but not
-1R1



Antisymetric: Yes

**PROVE STUFF**

x =y^2
y = x^2
x = x^4
x(x^3 - 1)
x = 0
x = 1

So these are both true when x = 0 or when x = 1

but in those cases y = 0 or y = 1


**So we proved that if we hav x= y^2 and y = x^2, then x = y all the time**

**hard**




Transitive: No

(4, 2) ^ (2, sqrt(2)) does not mean that (4, sqrt2)), this is false

16R4 ^ 4R2 does not mean 16R2



**This was a very hard, but good question**
❌


h. x ≥ y^2

Reflexive:  No
Symmetric: No
Antisymmetric: Yes  → It is very one way it seems. That is what it takes to be ≥
But prove it 

x ≥ y^2
y ≥ x^2


x ≥ y^2
and y ≥ x^2
With the second one, we can say y^2 ≥ x^4

SO x ≥ y^2 ≥ x^4

so x ≥ x^4

x - x^4 ≥ 0

x(1 - x^3) ≥ 0

x ≥ 0
AND
1 ≥ x^3

So x = 1, 0, -1















Transitive: Yes

16R4  ^ 4R2 → 16R2

x ≥ y^2
y ≥ z^2

Need to show x ≥ z^2

so x ≥ y^2 ≥ y ≥ z^2

So x ≥ z^2

Show that R = $\emptyset$ on S = $\emptyset$


Reflexive:
Reflexivity states that $\forall x \in S [xRx]$
There are no values of x to make this false. For a for all statement, that means it is vacuously true. 


Symmetry, transitivity: There are no elements, and so these for all statements are vacuously true as well. 

**For all statements are always true unless you find one counterexample**
**Also we can just straight away state that these are vacuosly true due to the forall statement domain being empty (this is just a given rule)**

# 14


# 15
Yes, it can 

Consider the relation on set {a, b}
And consider R = {(a, a)}

This is not reflexive because it doesn’t have (b, b), and it is not irreflexive because it has (a, a)



# 16

**VERY VERY IMPORTANT AND USEFUL**
R = {(a, b) | a divides b} on the set of positive integers


a.  R^-1
This one is interesting. Let’s just think about it 
We have all a divides by, so the inverse is just 

R^-1 = {(b, a) | a divides b} or  {(b, a) | (a, b) in R}
It is just all the values flipped 
(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4)
(1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1)……..


b. complemetn R

This is all values that don’t fit in this relation 
SO we can categorize it as 

A x B - R
This also works

Since A x B is the universe
Quite similar to the R^-1 but it should includ emore values

Like (5, 17), which was notinvolved at all, so not in R^-1 but exists here

{(a, b) | a does not divide b}






# 28


# 29


**THIS IS FULLY CORRECT! VERY GOOD! :D**
⭐

f: A to B is 1-1 and onto
R be a relation that = graph of f

Inverse relation of R is R = {(f(a), a)) | a $\in A$}
But interstingly…..this states that the f(a) maps to some a
We could maybe say then that 

R^-1 =  {(b, f^-1{b}) | b $\in B$}

So we could use the inverse
**NOT SURE ABOUT THIS ENTIRELY **

But all we’ve done is reverse the mappings, which should be fine since this is a 1-1 correspondence.

A = set of students at school
B = set of books in the school library  

R1: (a, b) = a is required to red book b in a course
R2: (a, b) student a has read book b

**Sepcifcially, these are the set of (a, b) in the relations. BE SPECIFIC**

a. 
This is the set of all studnets who are required to read a book or have read a book 

b. 
This is the set of students who need to read a book and have read it already 

c. 
This is the set of students who have read a book, or a required to read it but not both. 

d. 
This is the set of students who are only required to read a book, and no student who is has read it is included. So setudents who need to read a book and have not read it yet. 

e. This ist he set of studnets who have read a book but were not required to read it at all.

R = (a,b) = a is parent of b
S = (a, b) = a is sibling of b

$S \circ R$
This takes some parent, finds the child, and then gives the sibling of that child. 
Technically finding the parents other children

This takes a person a, binds their child b, and finds the sibling of that child b. 


**BE VERY CAREFUL, THINK IN ORDERD PAIRS**
$R \circ S$
❌
This some sibling, and gives their sibling, and then finds the parent of that sibling b. 
Just finds the parent of a sibling technically (unless they have different parents)

So we take some a and find the sibling of a, so some b. We then take b and we find some c such that (b, c), where b is the parent of c

SO this is finding the niece/nephews of some person

a. This will just be the set of all real numbers that aka R x R
This is also called the “relation that always holds"”

b. The union of these two is really just a != b, so R3 is a subrelation of R6

c. The intersection of these will just be R_3

d. The intersectino of these will be {(a, b) | a != b)}

e. R3 - R6 is the empty set, since the relation R3 is actually a subset of R6

![[Pasted image 20220709014925.png]]

This answer is also really really good
**simplify your problem down **



f. This will be the relation (a, b) such that a > b   since we remove all a < b
So R1


g.  This will be the relation a = b V a < b =>  a ≤ b

a = b only in first and not in second
and  a < b in second but not in first


h. Will be the realtion (a, b) such that a > b
This is in != but it is not in a < b 

So R4

**We can convert these to other sbecaues their domains and codomains map**

A o B states
x(A o B)z iff $\exists y [xBy \land yAz]$

a. 
R2 o R1
(a, b) where a > b      and then (b, c) where b ≥ c
So we get a > b ≥ c  
a > c
R2 o R1 = R1


b. 
R2 o R2 
a ≥ b and b ≥ c   →   a ≥ c

**Transitive idea** 
**This shows that R2 is tarnsitive**
**If this equals R2 that must mean R2 is transitive (or if it was a subst of R2 that also means its transtiive**
So we need a ≥ c AND there exists some number such that c ≤ b ≤ a
But since b can = c, this doesn’t even matter, since some value will always exist (aka the value b = c )

So a ≥ c   
So R2

If we think about it conceptually, technically all potential orderd pairs were already in R2, and so R2 circ R2 takes the transitive relaitons only tbh

**c.**
R3 o R5
(a, b) so a = b, and then (b, c) where b < c 
so a < c as well
So this is just R3

**INtersetingly, this tells us that R5 is an identity relation. Technically it’s an equality relation, and so it just retursn one of the relations interestingly. We can try R5 o R3 and get similar results. **

****

**d.**
R4 o R1
R4 is a ≤ b   and  R1 is a > b

(a, b) where a > b, and (b, c) where b ≤ c

b < a
b ≤ c

What can’t a and c be? We can do this in relation to any b values

I can really just choose any a and c 

(a, c)   and then choose b = min(a, c) - 1

So proved it’s onto kinda

R4 o R1 = R x R = R^2




So a and c have to be greater than b

**When not sure what it can be, look at what it can’t be**


**e.**
❌
R5 o R3
(a, b) such that a < b   and  (b, c) such that b != c
No R 5 is a = c
so a < b and then b = c
so a < c

so R3 still

a < b
c != b


a will always be != b
So a can equal c
but c could also be > b or < b, and in turn > a or < a




so a != b, and b != c
Can a = c? 
Well a < b, and c != b, so it could be the case that a = c 

3R4 and 4R3 possible 

R5 OR R6
Or wait
if both case possible then

R x R

**good tip is to split != into > or < **
**cases**
**f.**
R3 o R6

(a, b) so a != b  and (b, c) b < c

a > b  or   a < b  

c > b   

So also R x R
IF a > b and c > b, then they can equal each other for any b     or be not equal for any two values. 

b = 0      now only values that aren’t possible are (number, negatives)
But then if we want those, we can make b less than the negative we want. aka make b smaller.  

R x R

**g**

R4 o R6
(a, b) so a != b   and  (b, c) so b ≤ c

a > b   or   a < b
c ≥ b

b = 0     we get   (numbers, nonnegatives) and now (0, numbers)

R xR



So a != b, and it could be greater than b, but it could relate to any c, it could =

a != b < c


**h**
R6 o R6
a != b and b != c
(a, b)         (b, c)
Just choose a b that is not either a or c and make b whatever you wan
**For your rules you don’t always have to write them out super mathematically. **
Reflexive? Yes as in a(R6 o R6)a is always true 

**The book says that since the answer is not R6 itself, this means it isn’t transitive. Interesting, but if we think about it, if R6 contained all connections, it should have contained the transitive connections too. **

**ALWAYS NOT THE DOMAIN AND RANGE**


S_1 ^2
This probably means composition rather than cartesian product
**^2 for relations means compoostiion, while for sets it means cartesina product ig**

For this
We have all elements a > b  and   b > c 
so really just a > c

But be careful, 3, 2 wouldn’t work her
because 3 > nothing and nothign > 2 FOR INTEGERS

**SO BE VERY CAWREFUL OF DOMAIN AND RANGE HERE **

THis is S_1 **NO THIS IS NOT**
Hence this is transitive for sure **NO**

So we have to say maybe 
(a, b) where a ≥ b + 1
Essentialy there must always exist one integer between a and b

S2
a ≥ b
SO this is 
a ≥ b and b ≥ c  for integers
It could be the case that a ≥ b = c so thi sis fine
S2


S3
a < b   and b < c
so a + 1 < c   for example 
at least one integer between a and c

S5
a = b and b = c
so a = c

a != b and b != c

**3 and 4 relativel prime so if somethig is mod 3 and mod 4 then it must be the same mod 12**

![[Pasted image 20220709163645.png]]
(a, b) in R1 means a = b mod 3

(a, b) in R2 means a = b mod 4


R1 U R2 
Set of all numbers that are congruent mod 3 OR mod 4
if a = b mod 3 it can be [0, 1, 2] while for mod 4 it can be [0, 1, 2, 3]
So either of these is fine.
Hmm
In mod 12 then
a = b mod 12
a - b = 0 mod 12
Or
a - b = 0, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9  mod 12

**WHY? Because for any of these, if I reduce back to mod 12, then a - b = 0 mod 3 or 0 mod 4**
SO THINK CONCEPTUALLY ABOUT THIS
If we want a- b = 0 mod 12, try to think how we can get that
Doing a = b mod 12 gets kind of confusing ngl 
**Good tip with modulo when we have a = b mod 12, simplify the problem. **


b. R1 AND R2 
Set of all nu9mbers that are congruent mod 3 AND mod 4
a = b + 3k
a = b + 4m

Has to be a - b = 0 mod 12
No other multiple of 3 and 4 mod 12 here so this is it. 


4a + 4b  = 12k
3a + 3b = 12k
7a = 7b mod 12k
7 * 7 = 1

7 * 7 * a = 7 * 7 b mod 12
a = b mod 12
So this will be (a, b) where a = b mod 12

ALso good way 

c. Set of all numbers that are equal mod 3 but not mod 4
So they should be mod 3 but not mod 4

So (a-b) mod 12
WE can say
(a - b) = 3, 6, 9 mod 12
That way it is 0 mod 3 but not mod 4



d. Set of all nu9mbers equal mod 4 and not equal mod 3

a - b = 4, 8 mod 12

e. Set of numbers that are equal mod 3 or mod 4 , but not boht. 

a - b = 3, 4, 6, 8, 9 mod 12

All we did was remove the 0 mod 12 case where they both are dibisible.

**THIS WAS A GOOD BUT HARD QUESTION**
WE don’t need to use mod 12 though, but what I did wa sperfectly fine. The point of using mod 12 was just to show how we have many solutions but how we can reduc the prime.

Wrong easily lmao 
The empty relation doesn’t pass this for a nonempty a.

R on set A is symmetric IFF R = R^-1

Assume R on set A is symmetric and show R = R^-1 
subset proof
R subst R^-1 
(x, y) in R
By symmetry, (y, x) in R
By inverse
(x, y) in R^-1

R^-1 in R
(x, y) in R^-1
So (y, x) in R
BY symmetrcy
(x, y) in R


R = R^-1 → R on set A is symetric

Assume arbitrary (x, y) in R
We know then that (x, y) in R^-1 because R = R^-1
Then (y, x) in R because of inveerse relation
**OR**
(x, y) in R
so (y, x) in R^-1
And thus (y, x) in R because R^-1 = R
Thus symmetric.
