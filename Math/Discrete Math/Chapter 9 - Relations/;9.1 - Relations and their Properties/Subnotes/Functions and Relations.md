## How are functions similar to relations

The graph of a function is just a subset of the cartesian product as well. 
So the graph of a function will thus be some relation. 

Relations are more broad though. Functions exhibit a many to one or one to one relationship, whilst a relation can also exhibit a one to many relationship, which can be very very useful. 

Relations genrealize the graph of a function, so that they can be used to express many more interesting relations.
