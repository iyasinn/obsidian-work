# Combining Relations

[[;9.1 - Relations and their Properties]]

---

### Why can relations be combined with set operators?

Relations are just sets of ordered pairs, so practically, they can be combined. 


### How would you deal with domain/codomain
You would have to combine the domain and codomain as well when combining relations with set operators. 

If it is on the same set though, then we don’t need to combine anything. It is very important to note that all we’re doing is combining the ORDERED PAIRS based on the operators, but the domain and codomain should remain unaffected. 

### What should you make sure to use? 

Definitions of the set operators
