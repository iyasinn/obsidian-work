## Notes

### Define a Binary Relation

Binary relations are direct ways to showcase a specific relationship between two sets.

There are NO rules for binary relations in terms of how many pairs of connections they can make. 

So a binary relation is a set R or **ordered pairs**, where the first element is from A, and the second element is from B. 

For any pair of values, say (a, b), we say a is related to b. 

Relations can map any input to 0 or more elements. There are no restrictions. 

Relations have **domains** and **codomains**

It’s just that we **focus** on the edges 





### Explain the notation 

Firstly, when we say a binary relation from A to B, that means we are mapping elements INSIDE A to B, as if A is the domain and B is the codomain. 


$a \in A$ and $b \in B$
Assume **a is related to b**

Hence,
We can say

$aRb \equiv (a, b) \in R$
Here, 
These are equivalent, and just show that a is related to b. 

If a is not related to b, we can say $(a, b) \notin R$
Same as saying aRb where a line is going through the R

**Note about notation for a relation**
R could be any variable used to describe a relation. 
It could be R^2, or F, or C, it is just some variable assigned.

### Explain how to showcase a relation with set builder notation
R = {(a, b) | [Some predicate]}}

Make sure variables are defined 



### How can we visually show a relation. 

#### Graph

#### Matrix

### If an element doesn’t have any relation in a relation, does it still exist in the relation visually? 

Yes it will still be present in the graph of the relation, it just won’t have any edges connecting it. These need to always be accounted for. 

Just like in functions


### Explain loops in relations. How many times can we go around it in a relation?
In relations, loops can also exist where something relates to itself or a couple of relations form a loop. We can go through loops AS MANY times as we need.
