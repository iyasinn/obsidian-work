## Notes

### Define Transitive

So it is merely a travel based relationship. If you relate a to b and b to c, can you relate a to c? 

### Explain the predicate logic

$$\forall x, y, z \in A [xRy \land yRz \to xRz]$$

### Is the empty set transitive? 
Yes, through a vacuous truth

[[Vacouous and Trivial Proofs]]

### Give some examples
The equality relation is transitive
if a = b and b = c, we know a = c by the relation 


### What’s a good tip for transitive
Don’t always think about it in terms of 3 elements

Say aRb and bRa, then that REQUIRES that aRa, and so it requires that a is reflexive. 

THIS WILL MEAN that aRA BUT ALSO brB

So this actually tells us TWO THINGS. DONT FORGET THIS


That’s fine. 

It conceptually makes sense. The for all statements will cycle through all possible relations, and so we will get cases like this if they are possible (this case specifically happens if the edge is symmetric)



Also R2 subset of R implies that R is transitive, since all transitive relations are now present
