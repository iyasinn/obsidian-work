## Notes
### What is a relation on a set? 

>[!info] Relation on a set

>A relation on a set A is a relation from A to A

So a relation on a set A is a subset of A x A

### How do we define a relation on a set?
While we usually define relations as some relation P from A to B, we can also define a relation on a set

So relation R from A to A
Or… Relation R on A


### Can you have relations on an infinite set?
Yes, though it will be difficult to visually showcase them


### How many relations are there on a set with n elements?

This is truly asking, how many subsets are there on say N x N plane

Let’s think about for a seconod though, if there are N elements in n, how many elements will N x N have. Each n can make an ordered pair with n elements, so $n^2$ elements in N x N, which are ordered pairs. 

SInce we now want to see the number of subsets, this is really just the power set, so [[Power Set]]

And hence we have $2^{n^2}$ subsets, and hence that many relations.

### How can we visually represent such relations
We can draw the visual representations as normal.

But also, we could just draw the inputs, and draw arrows with how they relate to each other. This is a more simple method.
