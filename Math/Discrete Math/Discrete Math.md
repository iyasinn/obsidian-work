This is an important class!
UMICH: EECS 203


We are learning so much in eecs 203!


Our study of Discrete Math will begin with understanding the **Foundations**. 
 [[Chapter 1 - Logic and Proofs]]
 
Sets incredibly important structures!
[[Chapter 2 - Basic Structures]]

Induction is an incredibly important technique that you must master!
[[Chapter 5 - Induction and Recursion]]

Can we have sub proofs by contradiction? Just like proof by cases? But only if we split into arbitrar x and y
