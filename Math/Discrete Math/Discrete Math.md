This is an important class!
UMICH: EECS 203


We are learning so much in eecs 203!


Our study of Discrete Math will begin with understanding the **Foundations**. 
 [[Chapter 1 - Logic and Proofs]]
 
Sets incredibly important structures!
[[Chapter 2 - Basic Structures]]

Induction is an incredibly important technique that you must master!
[[Chapter 5 - Induction and Recursion]]

[[Chapter 6 - Counting]]

[[Chapter 7 - Discrete Probability]]

[[Chapter 9 - Relations]]

[[Chapter 10 - Graphs]]
