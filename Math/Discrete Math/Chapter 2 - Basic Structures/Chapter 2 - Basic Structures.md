A lot of discrete math is devoted to the study of discrete structures, which can help represent discrete objects. 

- **Sets** are incredibly important in helping build many types of discrete structures (just like a class/struct in coding help build different structures). Some examples of these structures are:
	- Combinations
		- Unordered collections of objects used extensively in counting. 
	- Relations
		- Sets or ordered pars that represent relations between objects
	- Graphs
		- Sets of vertices and edges that connect vertices. 
	- Finite State Machines
		- Used to model computing machines.
