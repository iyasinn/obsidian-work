## Introduction 

Sets are extremely useful in discrete mathematics. They are the ***fundamental structure*** upon which all other discrete objects are built. 

They are collections of objects that may or may not have common properties. 

Set theory in general is like another type of arithmitic/prop logic/modular arithmetic.
