$A \subset B \land B \subset C \to A \subset C$
More specifically 
$A \subset B \land B \subset C \to \forall x [x \in A \to x \in C]$

We will start this proof by considering an arbitrary element x such that x is an element of A. 
We know $A \subset B$, hence, all elements of A are also elements of B. 
Since $x \in A$, we know that $x \in B$
We also know that $B \subset C$, so all elements of B are elements of C. 
Hence, since $x \in B$, then $x \in C$.
Thus, for any arbitrary x, if $x \in A$, then $x \in C$
Thus, $\forall x [x \in A \to x \in C]$

By definition of a subset, we can thus conclude that $A \subset C$

The power set is just the set of all subsets, denoted by P(x) where x is the set that we are finding the power set of. 

Need to find the powersets
a. P({a}) = {$\emptyset$, a}

$P(A) \subseteq P(B) \iff A \subseteq B$
Need to prove: 
$P(A) \subseteq P(B) \to A \subseteq B$
$A \subseteq B\to P(A) \subseteq P(B)$
**Remember, to show that something is a subset, we need to show that an arbitrary element in the first set will indeed be in the second set.**
$P(A) \subseteq P(B) \to A \subseteq B$
Assume that the power set of A is a subset of the power set of B.
Since power sets are the set of all subsets, this means that all of the subsets that are present within A are also present within B. 
Now consider an arbitrary element of A called x. 
{x} will be present in set P(a), which contains all subsets of A. 
Since we know P(A) is a subset of P(B), then that means that {x} $\in$ P(B) as well.
Since $\{x\} \in P(B)$, we know that $x \in B$ since a power set contains all subsets, and if {x} is a subset, it means the element x is in itself an elementof the original set. 
Hence, we have shown that for any arbitrary elements x, if they are in set A, then they are in set B given that that P(A) is a subset of P(B).

$A \subseteq B\to P(A) \subseteq P(B)$
**REALIZE that in proofs like this, the left side is just OUR PREMISES**
We will show that if A is a subset of B, then P(A) is a subset of P(B)
Consider an arbitrary element in set P(A), {x}
We know {x} is a subset of A, so that x will be an element of A
We know that if x is an element of A, then it is an element of B since A is a subset of B
So $x \in B$
Hence we know that P(B) contains {x}, since P(B) is the set of all subsets
Thus, if A is a subset of B, then we know that all arbitrary elements of P(A) will also be elements of P(B)

Cartesian product of A X B X C

So the collection would contain 
(airlines, city, city)
And it would contain ALL combinations of this 

The subset of this cartesian product would contain all the flights from certain airlines from one city to another city. This could be used to track al the possible flights. 


# 32


# 33
$\emptyset$ x A is the cartesian product of the empty set and set A
However, since the empty set has no elements, there are no collections to make cartesian products with, so $\emptyset$ x A = $\emptyset$

A x $\emptyset$ also equivalent to the empty set. 
Here, for all elements A, there is no element to map to in $\emptyset$, hence this is equivalent to the empty set, $\emptyset$ x A = $\emptyset$

Thus: 

$\emptyset$ x A = A x $\emptyset$ = $\emptyset$

If A is a set, then A^2 is just A x A

|A x B| = mn



# 38
A x B
If A has m elements and B has n elements, and C has p elements. 

Well our ordered pairs would be (a1, b1, c1)
And so for each A, you have B elemeents, and for each of those B, you have C

So |A x B x C| = m * n * p[]

# 39

A^n will have   m^n elements


# 40


# 41
Because the ordered pairs in A x B x C will be (a1, b1, c1), a 3 ordered tuple

While the ordered pairs in (A x B), x C will be a 2 ordered tuple with the first element being a 2 orderd tuple, aka ((a1, b1), c1)
These two things are not the same at all.

**Technically this makes sense**

Since, for the same a and b and c, they convey the same information. **HOWEVER, OEVERALL, they are not entirely the same.

P(A x B) = P(A) x P(B)

We can prove this with a disproof, merely that one side is definitely not a subset of some other side. 

For P(A x B), we know that A x B is the set of all ordered pairs from A to B.
Taking the power set, we will be guaranteed to have the element $\emptyset$, since all sets have $\emptyset$ as an element. 

For P(A) x P(B), we know that P(A) and P(B) will have $\emptyset$ as an element. However
P(A) x P(B) will not have $\emptyset$ as an element, since this is a cartesian product that is a set containing all orderd pairs of P(A) to P(B), it will take each of these elements and make a tuple in the form (a1, b1)

This will never yield the $\emptyset$

**Hence, since $\emptyset \in$ $ P(A x B)  and $\emptyset \notin$ P(A) x P(B)
We know that $P(A$ x $B) \neq P(A)$ x $P(B)$



---
**Other method, not sure if it owrks. **




For P(A x B), one of the elements in A x B will be (a, b)
And the power set will have some sets that contain (A, b), but it will definitely have a set that is {(a, b)}

Now, for P(A) x P(B)
P(A) will contain {a}. and P(B) will contain the set of {b}

And P(A) x P(B) will contain 
({a}, {b})

This set, will NOT be contained within P(A x B), since that set is a set of sets that contain ordered pairs, while this set is a set of ordered pairs of sets. 

And {(a, b)} will not be in P(A) x P(B), since P(A) does not have a as an element and P(B) does not have b as an element. 

Hence, these are not equivalent.

a. The square of any real number is never -1. True

b. There square of some integer is 2. False

c. The square of every integers is positive. True

d. There is a real number that is equivalent to its square. True. 0 or 1 both satisfy this.

So assume 
(a, b) = {{a}, {a, b}}
(a, b) = (c, d) $\iff$ a = c and b = d

So

{{a}, {a, b}} = {{c}, {c, d}} $\iff$ a = c and b = d

{{a}, {a, b}} = {{c}, {c, d}} $\to$ a = c and b = d
Assume these are the same, then if they are the same then we know their elements are the same. 
This tells us that {a} = {c}, and so a = c
And {a, b} = {c, d}
Since we know that a = c, then b must be distinct and d must be distinct, then b = d

a = c and b = d $\to$ {{a}, {a, b}} = {{c}, {c, d}} 

We know a = c and b = d

So {a} = {c}
And
{{a}} = {{c}}
Now
{{a}, {b}} = {{c}, {d}} since b = d

 {{a}, {a, b}} = {{c}, {c, d}}

To list all subsets of your finite list

- List the empty set, and the set itself, since these are subsets of the finite list. 
- Then start listing each and every element in it’s own singlular set.
- Now, start making different unique combinations of each elements. 


NO
GIve a recrusive approach 

Start at some element
If there are more elements, then restart the process for some element in that set 
Keep on doing this
