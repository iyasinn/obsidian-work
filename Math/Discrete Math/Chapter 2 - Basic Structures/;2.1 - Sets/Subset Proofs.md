Subset proofs are very interesting

#### How do you show that $B \subseteq A$?
You can approach this similar to a natural deduction problem, since really, we are proving: $$\forall x \in \mathbb{U} [x \in B \to x \in A]$$
To prove this, we can :
- Consider an arbitrary element x in the universe. 
- Assume x is an element of B. 
- Use that information to show that if it is an element of B, then it must be an element of A. 
- Conclude the proof by stating that this is true for all arbitrary elements and that B is a subset of A.

#### How do you show that $B \nsubseteq A$

You merely need to find one element that is an element fo B but not an element of A

It is really just a proof by contradiction, as we assume it is a  subset of A, then find a counterexample

#### What two sets is every nonempty set ***guaranteed*** to have as a subset? Prove it

Every set is guaranteed to have the [[Empty Set]] and itself as its subsets. 

**Empty set proof for set $\mathbb{Z}$:** 
$$\forall x [x \in \emptyset \to x \in \mathbb{Z}]$$
The thing is, $x \in \emptyset \equiv F$
Since the empty set has no elements, so this is really just 
$$\forall x [F \to x \in \mathbb{Z}] \equiv T$$
This is vacuously true. 
This is av vacuous proof

**Set is a subset of itself proof**
$$\forall x [x \in \mathbb{Z} \to x \in \mathbb{Z}]$$
Equivalent to
$\forall x [x \notin \mathbb{Z} \lor x \in \mathbb{Z}] \to \forall x [T] \equiv T$

As seen, this is merely just trivially true, since it is always true. 
This ia Trivial proof

#### What subsets does the $\emptyset$ have?
The only subset it has is itself, the empty set. 
Or phrased in another way
The only subset is the empty set

Regardless, itâ€™s in the empty set in both cases. 


#### How do you show **equality** between two sets
To show equality between sets, we can merely show that they are both subsets of each other. That way we know they are equivalent.

###### How can you show two sets are equivalent?
- Use set equivalences to convert one to another
- Show that one set is a subset of the other through the process outlined, but do so in both directions.
