# Membership Predicate

[[Introduction to Sets]]
[[Set]]


#### What is the membership predicate? 

It is simply a [[Predicates]] that is true or false depending on if some given element is in a set. 

It is denoted by $\in$

$x \in A$ means that x is an element of set A. It is either **true** or **false**

$x \notin A$ meanst that x is not an element of set A. It is either **true** or **false**
It can be rewritten as 
$\neg (x \in A)$
The negation of the membership predicate 

You could even denote it as a predicate if you want to. 
P(x) woudl be very specicifc though, connecting to only ONE set
E(x, y) might work, where y is some set that can be inputted, and x is an element. 

We coan also have non membership predicates, just liek how we have $\notin$



#### Can you do truth tables with this? 

Yes, since this is predicate, you can do truth tables.
