# Set Builder Notation

[[Introduction to Sets]]

#### How do you represent elements in set build notation:
You characterize all the elements in the set by stating the property or properties that they MUST have to be members. 

>[!info] Set Builder Notation
>A statement in set builder notation can be written as:
>
**Statement:** {x | x has property P}
**Meaning:** “The set of all x such that x has property P”

This defines what x is and also what property any arbitrary x must have.

For writing X, we can also define the domain, such as saying that the domain is all integers. 

The | in set builder notation can be viewed as an “if and only if”
aka
“left side is an element of set if and only if right predicate true”

###### How can you characterize the universe?
You can declare your universe (domain of discourse) as some larger set, and then pull in any elements that have some property in that set.

Generally, this is used when you can’t describe all the elements in a set with some easy property.

###### What is the importance of predicates here? 
The property that the elements have to fulifll is usually some predicate 

And remember it’s okay to “Make” predicates, like making a P(x) predicate to say “x is prime. ”





#### When is set builder notation generally used? 
For sets where it is difficult to characterize all the elements. 
Such as the set of all positive rational numbers.

We could also do
$$Q^{+} = \{x \in Q \; | \; x > 0\}$$
