# Roster Method 

#### Explain the Roster Method

In the roster method, you describe a set by listing all the elements of it. 

All members of a set are  are listed between braces {}. 

For example, for set A, which contains {a, b, c, d}, we can use the roster method to write it as: 

A = {a, b, c, d}


#### How can you use ellipses in the roster method. 

If there is a ***common  and obvious*** pattern, then we can use ellipses. 

If we want to represent the set of positive integer less than 100, we can write: 

A = {1, 2, 3,…, 99}

Rather than writing out every single element. 
You can also use it for infinite elements

A = {1, 2, 3…}

Or you can have

A = {…, 1, 2, 3,…}

Be flexible :D

And since sets have no ordering, you could also do
A = {-1, -2, -3…}

This is backwards, but it it’s fine. As long as you can repeat some pattern.
