# Sets

As explained, sets are just an unordered collection of elements. 


#### What is the informal definition of a set?

It is important to note that a set is:

- Unordered
- Has no duplicates (distinct objects)
- “Contains” elements (or members)
- Members can be denoted with the [[Membership Predicate]]

###### What is an element? 
An element can be ANYTHING in a set. Generally, the set of all elements in a set is defined by the [[Domain for Sets]]





#### What are sets used for? 

They are used to grouping objects. 
More importantly, they can be used to build more specific discrete structures 


#### Do the objects in a set need to have a common property? 

They do not, though they can. So you can group just about anything you want.

#### How are sets and their elements generally denoted?
Sets are denoted with capital letters, while members are denoted by lowercase letters. 


#### Can sets contain other sets as elements?
Yes, sets can essentially have anything as an element, so they can also have other sets as an element.

#### Are sets ordered? 
No, sets are not ordered. 
There is no first or second element in a set. Instead, there is no ordering at all. We can think of a set as a bucket with all the elements tossed in, truly. 

But, they can be used to make **ordered** structures. 

However, as a fundamental structure, they are not ordered. 

#### When are two sets equal? Denote it with a predicate.

So for every single element in set A, that element must exist in set B 

So the predicate $\forall x [x \in A \iff x \in B]$

#### What happens if a set has multiple element that are the same? 


Sets have distinct elements. So if you have a set like {1, 1, 1, 2}, this is really just the same as the set of {1, 2}, since we only look at the **distinct** elements.
