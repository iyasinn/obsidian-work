# Empty Set


The empty set in set theory is defined. 
It is a special set that contains no elements. 

- Other words
	- Empty set 
	- Null set

#### How do we denote the empty set? 

$\emptyset$
Or
{ }


#### Do many sets end up being the empty set? 

It depends

The set of all positive integers that are less than 0 will be an empty set, for example. 

The set of all integers equivalent to 1 will not be an empty set, since it will have 1 element, namely, 1. 

Since we can have so many combinations of things, and weird nonsensical properties, many things might just be an empty set. 

#### What is a singleton set

A set that has one element. that element can, of course, be anything.
