# Venn Diagrams 

We can utilize Venn diagrams to visually represent sets! 

###### How do we draw a venn diagram? 
We will have a box to represent the universal set, aka the domain. 
	[[Domain for Sets]]

We then usually draw a set with something like a circle (any shape can be used), where dots can represent elements (but you donâ€™t necessarily need dots. )

###### What does it mean thus for two sets to overlap in a venn diagram? 
It means that they share elements.
