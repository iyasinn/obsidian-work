# Intervals 

[[Introduction to Sets]]
[[Set Builder Notation]]


#### What are intervals?
Intervals are a **type** of set 
They are usually sets of are numbers between two numbers a and b, with OR without a and b (or either)

We use **set builder notation** because we can’t construct real number sets. 

Usually the notation is 
[] = inclusive
() = exclusive

(a, b) = {x | a < x < b}

###### Assuming we have real numbers a and b where a < b, denote the different types of sets between them.

These all contain the real numbers from a to b, but some of them do or do not contain and b themselves.

Also, the set (a, b) is going to be a subset of things like [a, b] and (a, b] and [a, b)


#### What is a closed interval?

A closed interval does have bounds, since a and b are included in the closed interval. 

#### What is an open interval?

The closed open interval does not contain a and b. 

It also has no bounds, since we can get arbitrarily close to a or b

#### Can we make intervals with non-real numbers too? 
We can, but we would probably have to specific that x is an integer. 
But that’s not an interval, that’s just a set and we can specify that with set builder notation 


#### What is an easy way to visualize these sets?
