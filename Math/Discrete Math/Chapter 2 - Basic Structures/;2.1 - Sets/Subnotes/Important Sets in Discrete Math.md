Note: Some people don't view 0 as a natural number, though in this book it is. 
As you can see, for Q, there is no way to list all the numbers, so we use set build notation. Furthermore, there is no repeating property, rather that it is based on some non-repeating property. 


**Interesting note: The set of all real numbers contains all of these numbers, and there is no way to really represent it. **o

**Actually, the complex numbers contains the real numbers. **
