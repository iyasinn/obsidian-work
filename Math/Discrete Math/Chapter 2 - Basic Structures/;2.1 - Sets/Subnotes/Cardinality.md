Cardinality is merely the number of **distinct** elements, these can be anything from other sets to just regular elements. 

###### Do you count the elements within a set that is an element?
A = {1, 2, {3, 4, 5}}

This set only has 3 elements, 1, 2, and the set {3, 4, 5}. You don’t count the elements within the set that it contains. 


#### How do you denote the cardinality?
With an absolute value sign
| S | = cardinality of S

#### What is the cardinality of sets that are not finite? 

#### What is the cardinality of $\emptyset$

$|\emptyset| = 0$

--- 

#### What are some tips when finding the cardinality? 
Make sure to get rid of all distinct elements. 
This includes getting rid of distinct elements in sets so that you don’t get confused!
