Cardinality is merely the number of **distinct** elements, these can be anything from other sets to just regular elements. 

###### Do you count the elements within a set that is an element?
A = {1, 2, {3, 4, 5}}

This set only has 3 elements, 1, 2, and the set {3, 4, 5}. You donâ€™t count the elements within the set that it contains. 


#### How do you denote the cardinality?
With an absolute value sign
| S | = cardinality of S

#### What is the cardinality of sets that are not finite? 

#### What is the cardinlity of $\emptyset$

$|\emptyset| = 0$
