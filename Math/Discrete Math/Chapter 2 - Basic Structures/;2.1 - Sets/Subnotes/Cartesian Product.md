# Cartesian Product of a Set

The Cartesian product helps give us **new** data structures, specifically, an [[ordered n-tuple]]
Cartesian product is incredibly important!


## Cartesian product

#### What is the ***Cartesian Product*** of a set? âœ…

The Cartesian product of A and B is denoted by A x B. It represents the set of ALL ordered pairs (a, b), n orderd tuples, such that a is an element of A and b is an element of B

So really, itâ€™s the set of all **combinations** of elements from set A and set B


#### Express the Cartesian product in set builder notation âœ…

$A \;x\; B = \{(a, b) \; | \; a \in A \land b \in B\}$

#### What happens if you take a Cartesian product with an empty set?  âœ…
Will that will just yield an empty set. 
Like 
A x $\emptyset$ = $\emptyset$

Since the empty set has no elements

#### When is A x B equivalent to B x A

In two scenarios. When A = B

Or when either A or B are equivalent to the emptyset




#### Can you take the Cartesian product with multiple sets? ðŸ“—

Yes, you can, the collection will just have more elements, all of which are ordered.
