### What is the truth set of any given predicate?

Technically, since in set builder notation you put your predicate to the right, you always have a truth set for that specific predicate. 


### Use set builder notation for a truth set 

Assume x is an element of the universe U, and P is a predicate

$TSet = \{x \in D \; | \; P(x)\}$

### When will the truth set of a predicate be U? 

When $\forall x \in U[P(x)]]$
Generally this is true only if x is true over the universe

$\exists x \in U [P(x)]$

This will be true for all elements

And an element only exists if the domain itself is nonempty.
