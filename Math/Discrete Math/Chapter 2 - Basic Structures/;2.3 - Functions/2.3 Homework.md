f(x) = 2x + 1 if x‚â•0

f(x) = 2|x| if x < 0

f: $\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$

f(x) > 0 
This is the range 

f(x) is strictly increase  if and only if the function g(x) = 1/f(x) is strictly decreasing


Show: If f(x) strictly increasing, then 1/f(x) decreasing

Consider f(x). If f(x) is strictly increasing, then the value of 1/f(x) is decreasing, since f(x) is an integer, and 1/(integer) is a number < 1. A larger denominator means a smaller number. 

Show: If 1/f(x) is decreasing, then f(x) is increasing. 

If 1/f(x) is decreasing, then that means the denominator is getting larger. The denominator is f(x), so the value of f(x) is increasing. 

Hence, f(x) is strictly increasing if and only if the function g(x) is strictly decreasing. 


**Your expalanatio nwas too hand wavy. A better approach is to consider too arbitrary points and show that this is increaisng/decreasing. AnD REMEMBER PROOF TECHNIQUES.**

**REDO**

Need to prove:
f(x) is strictly increasing $\iff$ $\frac{1}{f(x)}$ is strictly decreasing

Prove: f(x) is strictly increasing $\to$ $\frac{1}{f(x)}$ is strictly decreasing

If f(x) is strictly increasing, then for x < y, f(x) < f(y)
We can actually manipulate the f(x) < f(y)
Since f(x) defined as > 0, multipling and dividing f(x) and f(y) doesn‚Äôt change the sign

So 1/f(y) < 1/f(x)

Hence, for x < y, we know 1/f(y) < 1/f(x), which means the function is stricly decreasing. 


Prove: $\frac{1}{f(x)}$ is strictly decreasing $\to$ f(x) is strictly increasing

1/f(x) is a bit weird to deal with. Not impossible, but weird, so let‚Äôs use the contrapositive. 

Contrapositive: f(x) is strictly decreasing $\to$ $\frac{1}{f(x)}$ is strictly increasing

f(x) strictly decreasing means if x < y, then f(x) > f(y)

So by division, 1/f(y) > 1/f(x)

So if x < y, then 1/f(x) < 1/f(y), which means 1/f(x) is strictly increasing

Hence, by contrapositive, if 1/f(x) is strictly decreasing, then f(x) is strictly increasing. 


Hence, 
f(x) is strictly increasing $\iff$ $\frac{1}{f(x)}$ is strictly decreasing


**Extra**
g(x) = 1/f(x)

so x < y, then f(x) < f(y), so we know that g(x) = 1/f(x)   >  g(y) = 1/f(y), so strictly decreasing 

**Simplying these more complex functions with an extra variable is extremely helpful. **

Prove that a strictly decreasing function from R to itself is one to one

f: R ‚Üí R

If a function strictly decreasing, then $\forall x, \forall y [x < y \to f(x) < f(y)]$

Prove: $\forall x, \forall y [f(x) = f(y) \to x = y]$

Consider an arbitrary x and y such that f(x) = f(y) 
This function is strictly decreasing, which means that all inputs have different outputs. So this means that x = y. 


**Not a good proof, well, it isn‚Äôt too bad, but I feel it‚Äôs reasonign is that oh, the function is decreasing, so all inputs have different ouputs‚Ä¶.but that just ameks a jump from the premise to the conclusion.**

**SO sometimes things like $\neq$ are actually good/helpful. **

Instead
Consider an arbitrary x, y
Look at the contrapositive; $x \neq y \to f(x) \neq f(y)$
If $x \neq y$. that means two cases
x > y 
Since function is decreasing, then f(x) < f(y) and so f(x) $\neq$ f(y)

if x < y
Then f(y) < f(x) and so f(x) $\neq$ f(y) 

In all cases we have $x \neq y \to f(x) \neq f(y)$


**Good note: **
**For $\neq$** we have two cases
And also an implies is given
$< \lor > \to \neq$

b. Give an example of a decreasing function from R to itself that is not one to one.

Hmm. I though thtis was hard, but **there is a difference between decreasing and strictly decreasing**

-x^3 is still one to one though, we need something that stays falt

Decreasing just means it‚Äôs ‚â§

f(x) = -x -1 if x < -1
f(x) = 0 if -1 ‚â§ x ‚â§ 1
f(x) = -x + 1 x > 0

$f(x) = |x|$

f: R ‚Üí nonnegative reals

If this is invertible, then it is a bijection, which means it is onto and one to one. 
However, this is not one to one
f(1) = 1, and f(-1) = 1. But since 1 $\neq$ -1, this means that the function is not one to one. 


Let the functions domain and codomain be redefined
f: nonnegative reals ‚Üí nonnegative reals. 

Proof it is one to one:
$\forall x, y, [f(x) = f(y) \to x = y]$

Consider an arbitrary nonnegative real x, y 
Assume f(x) = f(y)
So |x| = |y|
Since x and y are nonnegative, we can say |x| = x and |y| = y
So x = y
Hence, f(x) = f(y) ‚Üí x = y
Thus, $\forall x, y, [f(x) = f(y) \to x = y]$
By definition of 1-1, this function is 1-1 

Prove it is onto: 
$\forall y \in CD \exists x \in D [f(x) = y]$

scratch work:
Say we need to get a y, so f(x) = y
And we need to use | x | 
then just use x = y

Proof: 
Consider an arbitrary y 
Let x = y
So f(x) = | x | = | y | 
| y | 
So f(x) = y
Hence,  $\forall y \in CD \exists x \in D [f(x) = y]$

**Since this function is one to one and onto, it is a bijection. Since it is a bijection, it is invertible. **

g: A ‚Üí B

**a.** Show that if both f and g are one-to-one functions, then f o g is also one-to-one
f 1-1 $\land$ g 1-1 $\to f \circ g$ 1-1

Suppose f is one to one and g is one to one. 
Need to show $\forall x \forall y [f(g((x)) = f(g(y)) \to x = y]$
Consider an arbitrary x, y in A. 
Assume f(g(x)) = f(g(y))
Since f is one to one, that means if any f(a) = f(b), then a = b
So here, since f(g(x)) = f(g(y)), then g(x) = g(y)
Since is one to one, then if for some arbitrary a, b, g(a) = g(b), then a = b
Since g(x) = g(y), then x = y 
Hence, we have shown that if f(g(x)) = f(g(y)) ‚Üí x = y
$\forall x \forall y [f(g((x)) = f(g(y)) \to x = y]$
**By definition of one to one, $f \circ g$ is one to one.** 


**b.** Show that if both f and g are onto functions, then $f \circ g$ is onto.
f onto $\land$ g onto $\to f \circ g$ onto

Suppose f is onto and g is onto. 
Need to show $\forall y \in C \exists x \in A [f(g(x)) = y]$

Consider an arbitrary y $\in C$
f maps B to C. We know f is onto, so it maps to ALL y values. 
So We now $\exists x \in B [f(x) = y]$
Consider b, such that f(b) = y. Again, we know a exists because f is onto from B to C

We also know that g is onto from A to B, so it maps to all elements in B. Thus, there must be an element in A, let‚Äôs call it a, such that g(a) = b

Hence, if f(b) = y, and g(a) = b

Then f(g(a)) = y

We have shown that $\exists x \in A [f(g(x)) = y]$
**Here we are talking about the specific arbitrayr y we selected**

THus, 
$\forall y \in C \exists x \in A [f(g(x)) = y]$
By definitino of onto, then, $f \circ g$ is onto.

No

A has two points, and it maps them to one point in B through using g 
f maps the one point in B point to one one in C using f

f(g(x)) is one to one
f is one to one

However, g is not one to one



# 37

No, it doesnt. We can use a simply counterexample

f(x) = ax + b from R to R and $a \neq 0$ is invertible, then find the inverse. 

Prove one to one. 
$\forall x, y [f(x) = f(y) \to x = y]$
Assume f(n) = f(m) for arbitrary n and m
an + b = am + b
an = am
n = m 
So this is one to one

Prove onto
For any f(x), we can use x = ((z/a) - b)
Where z is the output we desire
And we can always get it
So this is onto


y = ax + b
x = ay + b
y = (x - b)/a

f^{-1} (x) = (x - b) / a

This is the inverse. 



# 42

So we need to show that f(S U T) = f(S) U f(T)

Consider arbitrary element of f(S U T)
x $\in$ f(S U T)
$f^{-1}(x) \in S \cup T$

$f^{-1}(x) \in S \lor f^{-1}(x) \in T$

$x \in f(S) \lor x \in f(T)$
So 
$x \in f(S) \cup f(T))$




# 43
So it‚Äôs saying that for the inclusion in part b, we need an example where it is a proper subset. If we can show an example where it might be proper, we are done. 

So we have to say that f(S AND T) is inside f(S) AND f(T)

**THINKING ABOUT EMPTY SETS USUALLY IS GOOD AND EASY TO DO **

# 44


# 45

First of all, the output will be a set
But here, there will actually be multiople oututs
This function isn‚Äôt really a bijection so we might have some weird results. As seen, we‚Äôll get multiple outputs in the inverse

g(x) = floor(x)
This is g: R ‚Üí R

a. {[0, 1)}
These are all the inputs that could have produced the output 0

b. {[0, 1), [-1, 0), [1, 2)}

c. $\emptyset$
The output is the set of all real numbers from 0 to 1
The issue is, no input can produce these outputs, these are all decimals, not integers. So the input that produced this will be the empty set. (we never said this function was a bijection to be fair)



# 46

f: A ‚Üí B
So 
$f^{-1}$ : B ‚Üí A

S is a subset of B, so S is in B.

Conceptually, this makes sense. 

Assuming we don‚Äôt subtract 0.5, we will always round up. But here‚Äôs the thing, the rule is to round up ONLY after you are larger than x.5

At least in this case. So, if we subtract 0.5, and you are not larger than 0.5 in whatever integer you are, then you will inevitabley have your integer be less than the current one and thenr ounded up (no way to not be greater than th previos 0.5)

On the other hand, if you are still in thes ame integer range, then you will round up no matter what happens. 

If eel the same effect could be achevied by doing floor(x + 0.5)


y = x + d
d is some decimal
Two cases

d > 0.5
y = x + d

f(y) = ceil(x + d - 0.5)

x < x + d - 0.5 < x + 1
Hence, ceil(x + d - 0.5) = x + 1
We round up 


d ‚â§ 0.5
y = x + d
f(y) = ceil(x + d - 0.5)

Since d ‚â§ 0.5

x - 0.5 ‚â§ x + d - 0.5 ‚â§ x

Hence, ceil(x + d - 0.5) = x
This is rounding down, or staying the same

**This is how the function rounds numbers**

**I think the decimal way to show this was pretty, pretty good. But I could be wrong. :(**
