# Bijective

[[Function Classifications]]
[[One-to-one]]
[[Onto]]

Bijection is a relationship that is based on one-to-one and onto

### Notes

##### What does it mean for a function to be bijective (or a one-to-one correspondence)
>[!info] Bijective / One-to-one correspondence
>
>A function is **bijective** or a **one to one correspondence** if and only if it is both [[One-to-one]] and [[Onto]]

##### Showcase bijective in propositional logic: 

$$f\;bijective \iff onto\;\land\;one-to-one$$
So

$\forall y \exists x[f(x) = y \land \forall z[f(z) = y \to z = x]]$

$\forall y \exists x[f(x) = y] \land \forall x, y [f(x) = f(y) \to x = y]$
