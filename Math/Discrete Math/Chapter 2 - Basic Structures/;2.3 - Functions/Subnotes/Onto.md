# Onto

[[Function Classifications]]

### Notes
##### What is the definition of an onto (surjective) function? 

>[!info] Surjective
>
>A function is **surjective** or **onto** if and only if the **codomain = range**
>
>So for every element in the codomain, there exists some element in the domain that maps to it/the codomain element is assigned to. 
>

So every single codomain element must be mapped to. 

##### Explain surjective in predicate logic.

A function is onto if and only if:
$$\forall y \in D_{c}\exists x \in D [f(x) = y]$$
D is the domain, $D_c$ is the codomain
