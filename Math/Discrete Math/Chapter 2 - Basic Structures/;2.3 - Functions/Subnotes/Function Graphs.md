### Explain function graph?

For a function: 
f: A → B

We can associate the set of pairs for this function, aka a pair such that f(a) = b, where the pair is (a, b) as an element of the cartesian product A x B

The set of all these pairs, which is a subset of the cartesian product is called the **graph**

It is usually displayed pictorally, in a coordinate grid, or with lines going from a domain element to a codomain element

### Now define a function graph formally
>[!info] Graph
>If f: A → B
>The graph of the function is the set of ordered pairs such that
>
>$graph = \{(a, b) \; | \; a \in A \land f(a) = b\}$
>
>Another way
>
>$graph = \{(a, f(a) \; | \; a \in A \land f(a) \in B\}$
>
>Technically we don’t need to check if the output is in the codomain, since by being a function, this is supposedly guranteed.

**The graph of A to B is EQUIVALENT TO THE RELATION**, so a function is not equivalent to a relation but the grpah is
