[[;6.2 - The Pigeonhole Principle]]

---

The pigeonhole principle is all about what MUST happen, not what CAN happen.

P / H is the average number of pigeons per hole, if it’s a fraction we round up and say at least one of the holes has that



How many cards do we need to guarantee 2 spades?
41, you might draw all other cards, then you can get spades
NOT a pigeonhole principle problem
Pigeonhole principle DOES NOT let you choose the pigeonhole, any pigeonhole could have at least two cards of the same type in this case. If that was the problem, then we just need 5 cards. 


The pigeonhole is usually the thing that two things need to have the same thing.

Two subsets need the same hole
So two subsets (pigeons) need the same sum (holes)


You need to check if it’s possible to have all objects in each pigeonhole. Aka are the pigeonholes compatible? 
this can pop up
If two pigeonholes can’t both be true, then we might need to do a PROOF BY CASES

After all, pigeonhole principle is a PROOF TECHNIQUE

Sometimes the pigeonhole principle isn’t the root way to solve the problem.
