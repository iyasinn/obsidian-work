The negation operator forms a new proposition -P that is the opposite of the original proposition.

There are many forms of the negation operator. Generally, the most important thing to realize is that the negation operator is merely the **NOT** of a proposition. 

>With a negation operator, you express it simply, or you can express it as a **NOT**
>p = "Michale's PC runs Linux"
>
>-p = It is not the case that Michael's PC runs Linux"

>**But we can also express this more simply as** 
>
>"Michael's PC does not run linux"


Another example:

Tim's smartphone has **at least** 32 gb of memory

It is not the case that Tim's smarphone has **at least** 32 gb of memory

OR

Tim's smarphone has **less than** 32 gb of memory. 

Since the original statement employs the $\ge$  symbol, that means our negation will be the opposite of this and employ the  $<$

So there are two ways to forms negations. The formal way or by using the definitions of words within the statement to form some equivalent statement.
