#proposition 

The Biconditional is similar to the [[Conditional]], however, it is more strict. 

The biconditional is only true when both p and q are true or when p and q are false. So they have to have the **same** values 

The **biconditional** implies that two things are #equivalent

There are also other forms. Try proving these!

	1. "p is necessary and sufficient for q"
	   
	2. "if p then q, and conversely"
	   
	3. "p iff q"
	   
	4. "p exactly when q"
	5. ≡

It is equivalent to ≡

This is important because we can use biconditioanls when thigns matter both ways

> This statement isn't fine alone, because we could say, if it isn't acute, then it can still have 3 angles less than 90, but that is acute! So to ensure consistency

> If 3 angles less than 90, then acute
> 
> Now what if it doesn't have 3 angles less than 90, it can still be acute, BUT, our other statement ensures that it has to be acute if it has 3 angles less than 90!
