The connective "or" in a disjunctoin corresponds to technically two ways the word could be used. 
The disjunction is the **inclusive or**, is true when at least one of the two propositions that form it are true. So P or Q  and Q are true.

Another way the englich connective **"or"** can be used is the [[Exclusive XOR]]

### Questions 

- Translate the statement “Students who have taken calculus or introductory computer science can take this class” in a statement in propositional logic using the propositions p: “A student who has taken calculus can take this class” and q: “A student who has taken introductory computer science can take this class.”
	-   We assume that this statement means that students who have taken both calculus and introductory computer science can take the class, as well as the students who have taken only one of the two subjects. Hence, this statement can be expressed as p ∨ q, the inclusive or, or disjunction, of p and q.
