# Contrapositive, Converse, and Inverse

These 3 propositional statements are fromed from the [[Conditional]]

For a statement p $\longrightarrow$ q

The contrapositive is $\neg q\longrightarrow\neg p$

The contrapositive and the regular conditional are the same in terms of their truth tables


The converse is $q\longrightarrow p$

The inverse is $\neg p \longrightarrow \neg q$


The converse and the inverse are also equivalent



**We can show that two propsotiions are equivalent by comparing their truth tables**

**Or for conditioanls we can see when they are false, since they are only ever false in ONE scenario usually**

Copnceptually though, we know that the contrapositive is equivalent to the regualr conditiona lis because the contrapositive is only false when q is false and p is true, which is the exact scenario the regualr doncitioanl is true


The converse and inverse are like new proposotioal sstatements
