**CHECK STUDENT SOLUTIONS**


	Q -> (-R and -P)  AND -((-R and -P) -> Q)
	
	Why? Because the -R and not P are NOT SUFFICIENT for Q, so we can't say that they they are true and Q is true, and so we are ensuring that if they are true and q is false, that amkese sense. These ARENT ENOUGH! But for a path 


**Not sufficient means that the other way around DOESNT WORK, IS FALSE. THIS IS US HAVINT TO TAKE WHAT WE'VE LEARNED FURTHER** 

	Necessary but not sufficient means that while q is necessary for p, it is not sufficient. All that maeans is that while q is necessary, p still has to be true by itself. q being true doesn't automatically mean that p is true. 

so p -> q would work

but q -> p wouldn't

(p V q V r) $\land$ (-p V -q V -r) is true when at least one of p, q, and r is true, and at least one is false, but false when all have the same truth value.

Essentially, the left proposition and the right proposition need to be the same. 

If p, q, r have different truth values, hence there is at least one true and at least one false, then the left proposition will be true because there is at least one true. The right proposition will also be true because there is at least one false, which has a negation and becomes true, which causes the entire proposition, which is combined with disjunctions, to be true. 
True AND true is true ✅

**Simpler way to word: Left is true with at least one true, and right is true with at least one false, so we need a true and a false. **


If all the truth values are the same, then this presents an issue. If all are true then the left prospotiion will be true and the right will be false, and if all are false then the right propsotion will be true and the left false. 
So in that way both propsotions cannot both be true together.

This is saying, that we have the general (-Pi V -Pj)
We make a statement

We have conjunctions for i where i is {1.....n - 1)
And for each of those, we form a dsjunction with -pi V - pj}


(-p1 V -p2) and (-p1 V -p2) and (-p1 V -pn)


AND

(-p2 V p3) and (-p2 V -p4) and (-p2 V -pn)

AND...

(-p_(n-1) or -p_n)


So this is true iff at most only ONE of p1,p2,p3...pn is true

Let's first assume all are FALSE, rather than 1 true and rest false
Then every propostion -p is -(false) = TRUE, and every propostion is TRE

So 
(true and true and true and true)
And
(true and true and true...true)
And
(true)

Will hence be true


**A big idea is that ever combination of potential numbers from 1 to n is comvined, propostions 1 and 2, 1 and 3, etc, 4 and 5, etc.** 

If integ er j
p_j is combined with all numbers in the set {j < n}

ANd if k is greater than j

Then there is a combination (-p_j V -p_k)



So if only one is true, then it will be -p = -(true) = false
But in every SINGLE pairing, it will be paired with a false propsotion, and -false = true, and ---> true V false = true


So every propostional statement ends up being TRUE and this is true


If you have more than 1 that is true, let's say TWO that are true

Since this comibnes every possiblity of x and all numbers greater than x, then it is obvious that thre is a propostion n and j, and let's say n < j


There will be a proptsiton such that

(-p_n  V -p_j)

And this propstion will be FALSE, because (-(True) V -(True)) = false V false = false


This SINGLE false will cause our entire propsiton to be false because all these sub propstions are combined with a CONJUNCTION

And one false in a conjunction causes the entire conjunction to be false.

This is true if at MOST 1 is true

We need one such that AT LEAST 1 is true

I think the best way to approach that is that if everything is false, then we need to have a false statement 

p1 or p2 or p3 or p4 or p5 or.......... pn


If all are false this is false
But if at least one is true, then this is true!


$\bigwedge\limits_{i=1}^{n-1}{\bigwedge\limits_{j=i+1}^{n}}(\neg p_{i}\lor \neg{p_{j})}\;\;\; \land\;\;\; \bigvee\limits_{i=1}^{n}(p_{n})$

The way this works is, the left side is the previous propsotion where AT MOST one is true.

The right side is a propostion that is just a disjunction. A disjunction requires that AT LEAST one is true, and otherwise, it is false. 

So toegether, if we need at most one to be true and at least one to be true to be satisfied, the only solution that works is where one propsition is true.

If it is a propsotion, it is either true or false. 

If it is true, then it would be saying it is false, which it can't be, since that means it is false since it tells the truth, which is contradictory. 
If it is false, then it would be saying it is false, which is telling the truth.

Hence, due to the fact it is paradoxical, it is not a propostion.

**Trick is to think of extreme edge cases, but also simplify it**

If there were 5 stataments only

5th must be false
1st is false 
2nd is false

4th false is the only one that makes sense






a. So each statement says "Exactly n of the statements in this list are false, for number n"

SOme of these statements will be true, some will be false. 

the 100th statement can't be true. Because that would mean the 100th statement is also false, but that would be a paradox. So the 100th statement is false.



Which means the 1st statement is true, because we know the 100th statement is false. 
This ist he same with the 99th statement, which if it was true means it would be false, paradoxical, so it is false. That also makes the second statement true. 

So
Start at 1, 100th is false


If we add 1, then we get 2, and 99


So 1 + n gives us more statemnts, but the statemtns we know are false are gonna be 100 - n 

1 + 49

50,  51

So the 50th statements says that 50 statemtns are false, which makes sense, from 51 to 100, including the 100th statement, is 50 incorrect statements. 



> **The quesiton is saying EXACTLY, so the 100th is incorrect**
> 
> Because all 100 can't be true. 
> Then the 1st statement, which states that exactly 1 is incorrect, might be true. 
> 
> Can the 99th statement be true? It can, because 99 except itself can be False
> 
> So the 99th statement would work
> 
> The issue is, here ONLY ONE statement can be true, and the rest HAVE TO BE FALSE




---








LIst has 99 statements

99th statement is 99 staemans are wrong, can't be the case, so it's wrong

So 99 - n + 1 statements are FALSE

and 1 + n sttemaanes are TRUE

1st statement is thus right

n = 48

49 -----  50 ------- 51

So the 49th statement says there are 49 incorrect statements
51th says there are 51 incorrect statements, which is false, becuase that would include itself 

What about the 50th? 

if the 50th is true, that means there are 50 false statements, but counting from 51 to 99 + 1 gives 49, so this is a lie

If the 50th is false, that means there are actually 50 false statements and a falsy statement is teling theturth. 

This is a paradox, and it cannot be the case.


SO there is no solution. 

**THE QUESITON SAYS AT LEAST**
So from 1 - 50, we can say at least 50 are false for sure, and 51 to 99, we can say those are false. More true than false is okay!


---



What if n is saying at least nth are false


10 


10th is false, 1st is true

5th is true, 6th is false
So at least 4 statements are false, and 6 statements are true 

FIrst 5 are true, last 5 are false (6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
5th - 6th


1 - 50 true, to 51 - 100 false


---


If we have 99, that's an odd number

If we have 3 statements

3rd is false, first is true

Now thd middle statemnt, if it's true it's lying and if it's false it's a congraduction


So we get a contradiction here
