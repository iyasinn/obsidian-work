#### Intro to propositions

>[!info] Proposition Defintion
>
>A Proposition is a delcarative sentence. It delcares a fact that is either true or false. 

###### Examples of propositions
1. This file was written in obsidian $\longrightarrow$  $\textcolor{green}{true}$
2. Toronto is the capital of Canada $\longrightarrow$ $\textcolor{red}{false}$
3. 1 + 1 = 2 $\longrightarrow$  $\textcolor{green}{true}$
4. 7 + 3 = 3 $\longrightarrow$  $\textcolor{red}{false}$

These are all propositions!

>Any statement that is one of the following is ==not== a proposition
> 1. It is not declarative
> 2. It is a predicate (it contains variables with unknown values)
>

#### General Terminology 
**Propositional Variable**: Any variable letter that can represent a proposition.

**Truth Values:** A truth value merely represents if a proposition is $\textcolor{green}{true}$ or $\textcolor{red}{false}$.

**Atomic Propositions**: Propositions that cannot be expressed in terms of simpler propositions. They are represented by a single variable. 

**Compound Propositions**: Propositions that are formed through **logical operators**. These are simply just more complex NEW propositions formed from our original propositions.

#### Logical Operators/Connectives

You can apply many different types of logical operators that can be used to make more complex **compound propositions.**

Operators form new propositions from one proposition.
Connectives form new propositions from two original propositions. 

The common logical operators are:
1. [[Negation]]   -
2. [[Conjunction]]    $\land$ 
3. [[Disjunction]]     $\lor$
4. [[Exclusive XOR]]      XOR
5. [[Conditional]]   $\longrightarrow$
6. [[Biconditional]]     $\leftrightarrow$

#### Truth Tables 

These are easy ways to showcase the truth values of propositions. They are usually used for compound propositions. 

For example: 

$p \rightarrow q$

| p   | q   | $p\rightarrow q$ |
| --- | --- | ---------------- |
| T   | T   | T                |
| T   | F   | F                |
| F   | T   | T                |
| F   | F   | F                |


A good tip is to split your large compound proposition into smaller propositions that can be shown in the truth table, making it easy to deduce the truth value of the overall proposition.

#### [[Converse, Contrapositive, and inverse]]

We can form new propositions using the [[Conditional]] 
Essentially, we can take the simple p $\longrightarrow$ q and make new propositions. 

Read more about them here: [[Converse, Contrapositive, and inverse]]

The Contrapositive is equivalent to the the original statement, and the inverse and converse are equivalent to each other, but not to the original statement. 

So the converse/inverse are new propositions that are created.

#### Equivalence

Two propositions are only considered **equivalent** if they have the **same** truth table.
