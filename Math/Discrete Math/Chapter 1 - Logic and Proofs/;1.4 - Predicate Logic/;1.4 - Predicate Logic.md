# ;1.4 - Predicate Logic

**Links -** [[Chapter 1 - Logic and Proofs]]

---

Propostional logic isn’t adequate enough to express all mathematical statements. What do we do in that case? We can instead utilize quantifiers! This is a new form of logic called **predicate logic**. 

We will be exploring a more powerful type of logic called **predicate logic!**. This is an extension of propositional logic. 

- This is also known as **first-order logic**, and it focuses more on objects, properties, or relations. Read more here:

Predicate logic consissts of objects, predicates, and quantifiers. 

Objects and predicates are similar, and so they are contained in the same chapter.
