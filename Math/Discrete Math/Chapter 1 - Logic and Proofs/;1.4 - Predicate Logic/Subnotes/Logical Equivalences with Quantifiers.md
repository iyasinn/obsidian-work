It is possible to have logical equiavlences with quantifiers! 

##### When are statements with quantifiers logically equivalent? 
?

- So the statements are only equivalent if they always have the same truth values regardless of:
	- The predicates substitued
	- The domain of discourse that is used 
- We can use the $\equiv$ symbol 

So what matters is the ordering of the quantifiers




##### Hence what is the approach in general to proving statements with quantifiers are logically equivalent? 
Generally, we need to show they always take the same truth values to be true, regardless of the predicate itself. 

That’s what’s important. The **predicate** isn’t important, it’s more so the type of values we need to enter thanks to the quantification. 

You also need to assume a **common domain**. 

We can do this by assuming that if one statement is true, then the other is true, and if the other statement is true, then the first is true. This is merely a **biconditional**

##### Prove the following distribution laws

Exercise to you…the reader. :3
