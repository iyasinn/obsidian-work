### What is a predicate?
?

-
Predicates are statements that are composed of **objects** and **relations**

#### What is an object/subject?
?
An object, also known as a subject, is some **variable** asociated with the predicate.

#### What is a relation/predicate?
?
This is the **main** thing we focus on in predicate logic. 
-
A **relation**, also known as a **predicate** (I know, same term), is some property that the subject of a statement can or cannot have. “is greater than 3”, for example, is some predicate that a subject could have.

### What is the notation for a predicate?  
?
We can represent a **predicate** as a propositional function. 
We can do something like:
-
P(x)
P is the actual predicate, you can use any letter to represent it
There can be any number objects, here we just have x, but y ou can have any
-
And thus this statement can represent **anything**
Just like a statementin programming. And if you plug something it, then it will be true or false. 
-
P(X) itself merely means P at X, as in the predicate acting on variable X. 
-
A propositoinal function is like a regular function, except it forms propsotions! We can plug in some value for X, which will allow us to form a propostion that is either true or false (depends on the predicate and what we plug in).

### How is a predicate different from a proposition? 
?
A predicate is not a propostion.
But, if you assign values to all the objects in a predicate, then it becomes a propstion. 
-
There is a second way to turn it into a propstion, which is through quantifiers.

### What is an n-ary predicate? 
It is a propstional function that contains **n** variables. It is extremely useful in math and computer science.

### Do predicates need to only involve one variable?
?
No. They can involve multiple variables. But they must only involve one type of relation.

In fact, a general predicate itself can also consist of multiple predicates. Everything is very adaptable. 



Preconditions vs Postconditions
---

Predicates are great ways to represent all valid preconditions and postconditions. 

### What are preconditions? 
Preconditions merely represent statements to describe valid inputds

### What are postoconditions?
Statements that represent valid outputs that need to be satisfied by the valid preconditions (inputs)
