We can negate quantified expressions as well!

## De Morgan Approach

### Summarize de morgan’s law for quantifiers. How can you prove it when you have a finite domain.

### Translating to English
Translating a negation to english is particularly hepful. 

When you have a universal quantifier, 
$\forall x P(x)$
This states that all x values satisfy P(x).
But now, what if we negate this. Now we know all x values don’t satisfy P(x). 
The only way to show this would be that there must be some x value that doesn’t satisfy P(x)

Why not
$\forall x \neg{P(x)}$

This states that for all x, nothing satisfies P(x). This is not the negation, this is extremely strong. The negation of our origninal is merely that our original can be broken, and the least you need to do that is having at least ONE example that isn’t P(x)

So a “for all” will lbecome an “exists”
