[[Quantifiers]]

---

##### Why is it mandatory to define a domain for our quantifiers? 
Many mathematical statements assert a property for a range of values, known as the domain. 

###### What is the universe of discourse? 
>[!info] Universe of discourse
>Also known as the domain of discourse, or simply as the domain, it is the range of values that are possible used for some subject in a propstional function. 


##### Why do expression with quantifiers change as the domain changes? 
Because changing the domain adds or removes cases where the statements with quantifiers can be true or false! This is incredibly important!
