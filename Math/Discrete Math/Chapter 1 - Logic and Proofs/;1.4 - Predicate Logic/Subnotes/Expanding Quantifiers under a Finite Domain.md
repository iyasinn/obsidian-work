# Quantifiers under a finite domain

### Why can we rewrite quantifiers when the domain isn’t infinte?
Beacuse we can actaully write out each of the propositons formed by pluggin in a value from the domain into the predicate for the quantifer (or the statement in general)

If it was infinite, this is impossible.

Universal Quantifier

##### How can you rewrite your quantification if the domain is finite? 
Since your domain is finite and you can list all values for the predicate

We can view this as a [[Conjunction]]

This makes sense, since the quantification is only true when all values are true for the predicate involve

Existential Quantifier

##### How can you rewrite your quantification if the domain is finite? 
Since your domain is finite and you can list all values for the predicate

We can view the existential quantifier as a lot of [[Disjunction]]

This makes sense. The quantification is only true when at least one of the values for the predicate is true.

Looping

How can we think about universal and existential quantifiers in regards to looping when fiding the truth values?

This only works when we don’t have an infintie domain. If the domain is infinte, we can’t think about going through infintie values.
