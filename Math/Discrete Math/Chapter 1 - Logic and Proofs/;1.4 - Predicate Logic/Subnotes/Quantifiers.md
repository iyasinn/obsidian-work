Introduction

There are two ways to turn a propostional function into a proposition
1. Plugging in values 
2. Quantification 

###### What is quantification? 
**Quantification** allows you to **express** the extent to which a predicate is true over some range of elements. Hence, itâ€™s like plugging in **multiple** values for a variable and seeing if the propositional function is true. 

The Quantification of a statement is merely a propsitonal function turned into some proposition. 

This study is called **predicate** calculus 





Quantifiers
---
Quantifiers are the specific notation that allows us to take a propsotional function, turn it into a **propostion**.

Defining a domain is incredibly important for quantification.

###### What is the scope of a quantifier?  

The scope is the part of the logical expression that the quantifier is applied to.
