##### What is the definition of the Existential Quantifier?

Many mathematical expression sasser that there **exists** an element with some property.

We use the existential quantifier to form a propisiton that is true if such an element exists of the domain. 

Hence, it is true when there is at least ONE value that ist rue for the predicate in the domain.

###### What are other ways to express the existential quantifier? 
- There is an x such that P(x) 
- There is at least one x such that P(x)
- For some xP(x)


##### Why is the domain important? 
The meaning of the existential quantifier can change, aka it can become true or false as the domain changes. Hence, you need to specify a domain. 


##### How can we prove an existential quantifier is true or false? 

An existential quantifier is ONLY true if and only if there is at least one case where it is true. 

Itâ€™s false if and only if there is no element x in the domain for which the predicate is true, hence it is always false. 

If there is no true value, then that means that the quantification is false.

So if the domain was empty, then the existential quantifier is false because there is no value for which it is true.
