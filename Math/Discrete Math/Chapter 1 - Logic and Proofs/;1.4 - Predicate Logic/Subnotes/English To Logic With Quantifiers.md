Translating from english to logic is incredibly important. 

Note, there is no “cookbook”. The best way to do this is by practice and a step by step logical approach. 

This note will give you examples then guide you through them, giving you **insights**

### Insights 
- When restricting a statement with a universal quantifier, we use a conditional. 
- When restricting a statement with an existential quantifier, we use a conjunction
- It is okay to have a predicate like V(x, y) where it states “x has visited y”
	- And it is okay to assign a value to y, such as “England”. Remember, this is just one of two ways of turning a predicate into a propstion (the other is using a quantifier. )
