### What is the definition of the Universal Quantifier?

We define it as **for all**

It is true when all values are true for the predicate, or form a true proopsition.

Note: You need a domain. If you don’t have a domain, then technically this would be true since there are no values for which it is false. Regardless, always define a domain.


##### What terminology can be used to express universal quantification? 
- For all
- For every
- All of 
- For each 
- Given any 
- For arbitrary 
- For each 
- For any
	- It’s best to avoid using this because “for any” is ambiguous and coule mean “every” or “some” 

There are lots of different ways you could word it. 


### Can the domain change the truth value of a universal quantification?
It can. Different domains my yield different truth values overall as we include or exclude certain values. 


### How can we prove a universal quantification is true or false?

To prove it is true we need to check all examples in the domain of the object in the predicate and see if the argument is true. 

To prove it is false we just need one **counterexample** 

That’s why an empty domain will have a universal quantifier as true, since there exists no counterexample. 

If there exists **no** counterexample, then the quantification is **true**

#### What is a counterexample 
A counterexample is merely any situation where we can show that the universal quantification of our predicate is **false**. 

###### Why do we only need on counterexample?
Because the universal quantification implies that the predicate is true for all values of x. 

So even one counterexample ensures that this isn’t the case.
