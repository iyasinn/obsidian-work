Domain: All students at your school.

a. 
There exists a student who can do both things
$\exists x(P(x) \land Q(x))$

b. 
but is like “and”

$\exists x[P(x) \land \neg{Q(x)}]$



c. 
 
$\forall x[P(x) \lor Q(x)]$


d.

**HARD**

$\forall x[\neg P(x) \land \neg Q(x)]$

$\forall x \neg[P(x) \lor Q(x)]$

$\neg \exists x [P(x) \lor Q(x)]$

So there doesn’t exist someone who can speak russion or program 

**The not here is applying to the entier statement of p or q**


The first here is false because it asserts that all students only don’t have at least one, so there could be someone who can still speak russian, going against our statement. 

The second one implies that someone cuold also still know one of them, since you only need one false for an AND to be false. 

SO really, just make a statement, and COMPARE to the original phrase
