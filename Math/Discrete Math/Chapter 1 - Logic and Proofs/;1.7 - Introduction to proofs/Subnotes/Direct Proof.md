## How does a direct proof work? 

#### How does a direct proof work for some statement $p \to q$
A direct proof works by **assuming** that **p** is true. 

Then using that assumption, we try to use theorems, rules of inference, axioms, etc, to show that q MUST be true.

This ensures that we never get the combination of $T \to F$

**Direct proofs aren’t always easy. Usually they are straightforward, but sometimes they might require specific insights. **


##### What do you need to do before assuming p if you have a $\forall$
First state that we must consider an arbitrary integer or whatever element of the domain that we are talking about. 

##### How would it work in natural deduction?
You would assume the premise, p, is true, then use the rules of ND to see if you can conclude q. 

In that way, we can represent all of our proof techniques in natural deduction. 

Specifically though, we wouldn’t use anything like a negation intro, or an or elimination. Instead we would simply just conclude things from the implication and it would be very straightforward.
