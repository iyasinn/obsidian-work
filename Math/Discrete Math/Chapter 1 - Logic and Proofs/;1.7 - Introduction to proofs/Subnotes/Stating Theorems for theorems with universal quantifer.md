# Stating Theorems that have $\forall$

[[;1.7 - Introduction to proofs]]

[[Universal Quantifier]]
[[ND - For All]]

---

Generally, theorems assert properties that hold for elements in a domain. They can also assert existence and stuff, but we will focus on that later.

Generally, we donâ€™t always need to show the universal quantifier in this case, but it is ALWAYS there



#### Hence, what does the firsts step of a theorem involving something that occurs for all elements use? 

Generally it implies that some arbitrary element exists. 

Truthfully, ALL REGULAR PROOFS that are wrody can be written as natural deduciton proofs. 

So we begin by making some generalization of an element, and then using the [[ND - For All]] instantiaion rule to show that holds for all elements in the domain.
