## Introduction 
This section will help us better understand the notion of a proof, as well as a constructing of proofs. 

- What is a proof? 
	- A proof is valid argument that estabilishes the truth of a methematical statement.  
- What can proofs use? 
	- Hypothesis given, axioms, and previous theorems (lemmas)
- What is the difference between informal and formal proofs? 
	- **Informal proofs** focus more on being easier to understand/analyze for regular readers. 
	- **Formal proofs**, like through natural deduction, are very rigerous and can be difficult to understand in depth. 


Important to note: 
This chapter will focus on proving theorems in the form:
$\forall x [P(x) \to Q(x)]$

So think about **conditionals** and **universal quantifiers**

Also, it is imporatnt to note that we can reprsent ALL of our poofs in natural deduction. 


## Terminology

- Theorem
	- A statement that can be shown to be true. 
	- A less important theorem can be called a **postulate**
	- They can also be called **facts** or **results**
	- **Important:** A theorem can be represented 
- Proof 
	- A valid argument that establishes the truth for a theorem
- Axiom (postulates)
	- Statements that are assumed to be true
- Lemma
	- Less important theorem proved earlier
- Corollary
	- Theorem established directly from a thoerem that has been proved. 
- Conjecture 
	- A statement proposed to be a true statement, usually on the basis of some evidence, a heuristic argument, or the intuition ofan expert. When a proof of a conjecture is found, the conjecture becomes a theorem. Many times conjectures are shown to be false, so they are not theorems. 

## Notes

**Note on Proofs:** You must be VERY thourough in your wording. Even the smallest of things, which may seem obvious, should just be stated to be safe. 

[[Stating Theorems for theorems with universal quantifer]]

[[Proving a Theorem with Universal Quantifier and Conditional ]]

Note, these are all proof techniques with **CONDITIONAL** statements and $\forall$ statements, usually in the form $\forall x [P(x) \to Q(x)]$

[[Direct Proof]]

**Indirect Proofs** - Proofs that are not direct proofs.
