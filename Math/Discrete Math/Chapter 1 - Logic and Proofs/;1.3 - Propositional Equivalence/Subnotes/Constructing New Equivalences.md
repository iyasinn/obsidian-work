# Constructing Complex Equivalences

[[;1.3 - Propositional Equivalence]]

[[Logical Equivalence]]

[[Equivalence Laws]]

### Why can we use the [[Equivalence Laws]] to simplify logical equivalences

We can utilize them as a sort of algebra to simplify complex equivalences.

This provides lots of flexibility!
They can be simplified to logically equivalent compound propsitions!

### Do we need to use truth tables? 

We could use truth tables, but even better, we can now use our equivalence laws, since we prooved those with truth tables. 

### If a compound propsition is a [[Tautology, Contradiction, and Contingency]], what will be apparent in the simplified logically equivalent proposition

Tautology: The propsition will simply to just **true**

Contradiction: The propstion will be logicall equivalent to just **false**

Contingency: The propostion will neither simplify to true or false. But it can of course be written as another propsition.
