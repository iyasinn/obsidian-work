#### Explain conceptually why it makes sense
Conceptually it makes sense because the conditional works such that if p is false, it is definitely true. this is the case for our disjunction we have formed. However, if p is true, then q has to be true, which is also the case here, since if p is true, then -p is false and the entire statement is only true when q is true.
