Laws 
---

There are many fundamental laws that show us that two compound propostions are logically equivalent.

- Notes and tips
	- The absorption laws are kind of like opposites of each other
	- You can only prove these laws via truth tables really
	- Identitiy requries basic values like To rfalse
	- Domination requires the true or false to win
	- These laws **can be used backwards**

- This is a quick image of all the laws. These must be proven with a truth table. 
	- Identities always deal with the base case Like commutativity is 1 + 2 = 2 + 1 Same with logic p V T In logic T and F are our smallest base cases
	- You can also think of these backwards. You can think of them both ways.

Some important ones to explore:
- [[De Morgan's Law]]
- [[Conditional-Disjunction]]
- [[Distributive Law]]
- [[Associative Law]]


Why are logical equivalences they important?

##### How do we prove these?
We're introducing fundamental rules that allow us "manipulate" popostional relations.

So these have to be proven via **truth tables**

But that means for later complex compoudn propstions, we don't have to use **truth tables**


##### What can we do with these?
We will be able to use these to manipualte propostional statements

These form the fundamentals of allowing us to do equivalence relationships.

Think of them like the basics of algebra

We're introducing fundamental rules that allow us "manipulate" popostional relations.
