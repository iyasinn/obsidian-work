# Tautology, Contradiciton, Contingency

[[;1.3 - Propositional Equivalence]]

---

Tautologies and contradictions are important in mathematical reasoning!

### Definitions

###### Tautology Definition?
>[!info] Tautology:
>
>Tautology: A compound propositiion that is always true, no matter what the truth values of the propostiioanl variable that occurs in it. 
>


###### Contradiction Definition?
>[!info] Contradiction:
>
>Contradiction: A compound proposition that is always false no matter the truth values of the propostiioanl variables wtihin it. 
>

###### Contingency Definition?
>[!info] Contingency:
>
>Contingency: A compound propostion that is neither a **tautology** nor a **contradiction**.

### Checking if something is a tautology

- How can we check?
	- We can make a truth table to show that something is definitely a tautology. We can also use logical reasoning and make assumptions. 
	- We can also use equivalences to transform one compound propostion into another 
		- Tautologies can be turned into a single True value. 
		- Contradicitons can be turned into a single False value
		- Contingencyâ€™s can just be simplified normally

### Example

- Prove $p\lor \neg p$  is a tautology. Prove $p\land \neg p$ is a contradiction.
