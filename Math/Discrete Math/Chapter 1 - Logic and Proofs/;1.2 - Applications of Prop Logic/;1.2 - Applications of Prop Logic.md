### Translating to English 

It's important to be able to translate logical statements from logic to english and vice versa!
This allows us to take english sentences, turn them into logical statements, analyze them as logical expressions to determine their truth values, and use logical inference.

> Note: You can be flexible! There are often many ways to do this. Don't confine yourself to a specific way. And also look at the statement and see if some parts cancel out.

	  This has many solutions!
	  With a pure translation
	  
	  $\neg{s} \rightarrow (r \rightarrow q)$
	  
	  Also works!
	  
	  But the method they gave focuses more on taking advantage of what is guranteed. 
	  
	  We are guaranteed we can't ride the rollercoaseter if we are under 4 feet tall, unless we are 16 in which case anything can happen. 
	  
	  So if we are not over 16, and under 4 feet tall, then we definitely can't go on the rollercoaster. 
	  
	  Not that the above sentence is the p, and going on the rollercoaster is not allowed, so we do -q, because the guarantee is we can't go on the rollercaoster.
