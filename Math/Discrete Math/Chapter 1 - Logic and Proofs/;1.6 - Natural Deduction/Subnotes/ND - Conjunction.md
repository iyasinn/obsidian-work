### What is the introduction rule for $\land$

This makes sense. If you have **p**, and you have **q**, and you know that both are true, then you should be able to combine them with the conjunction operator. 

So as long as you have any two propositions, then you can combine them. 

Cite the lines that you use to make a conjunction


### What is the elimination rule for $\land$

This is also quite simple to understand. 
If p and q are true, then that means that one of them is definitely true. 

We can use this to either get p, or we can get q. 

Make sure to cite the line you do the elimination on.
