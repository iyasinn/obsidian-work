## Why are arguments important? 

They form the fundamental of **proofs**

## What is an argument

It is a sequence of statements that end with some **conclusion**

### What are premises? 
The original statements given for the argument. 
### What is a conclusion? 
The final conclusion that can be deduced in the argument. 

### When is an argument valid? 
When all the steps logically follow from the previous steps. Hence, every statement must be **implied** by some sequence of statements before it. 

Furthermore,
It is valid when
The premises are true, AND the conclusion is true. And if the premises are false, then we should have NO WAY to determine what the conclusion is. 

### How can you write a valid argument as a quantification then? 

$\forall \text{Truth Values}[\text{Premises} \to \text{Conclusion}]$
This must be a **tautology**, aka it must be equivalent to true for any and all arguments.

If this is the case, then your argument is valid. 

This is also how a proof work. A proof must be true for all values. j

If the premise is false, then it doesnâ€™t matter what the conclusion is. 

But if the premise is true, then you should be able to imply the conclusion. 

### What is an argument form
Just your word argument written in propositional logic.
