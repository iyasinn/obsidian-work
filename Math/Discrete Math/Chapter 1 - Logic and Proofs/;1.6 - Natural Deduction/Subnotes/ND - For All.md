### What is a for all introduction

You have to assume a **new arbitrary** variable. Then you need to show that it always leads to the conclusion like P(c) here, which lets you know that you can apply the universal quantifier. 

### What is a for all elimination 

![[Pasted image 20220531190557.png]]

Since a for all is true for all variables, you can do a for all elimination IF YOU HAVE a pre existing variable. 

#### Why do you need a pre existing variable? 
You need a pre existing variable because technially a for all can be true if you have no elements in your domain. If you have no elements in your domain, there is no false value and the for all is true. To get around that, you need to make sure you already have an element, which you must have found before (like through an exists elimination. )
