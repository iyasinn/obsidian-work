# Assumption Boxes

### What is an assumption box? 
It is merely some sort of assumption that you can assume to be true. You can use that assumption box to then use the previous lines to gain some new insight from the assumption box. 

It lets you do many new introductions and elimination rules. 

### What variables can be used inside and outside an assumption box. 

If an assumption box comes before a line you’re on, you can’t use anything inside that assumption box except for the introduction/elimination rules that the assumption box lets you do. 

If you are inside an assumption box, you can use all lines that come before it, except for things inside some other closed off assumption box.
