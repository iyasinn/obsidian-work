### What is an Exists introduction?

To do an introduction, P(c) needs to be a proposition where c is some value in the domain of x that is true. 

That way, you can create the existential quantifier here. 

#### Why do you need a pre existing variable. 
You need a pre exiting variable because otherwise, you donâ€™t know if the exists is true. There may be no elements in the domain, which means the exists is false because no true value can be deduced. 


### What is an Exists elimination?

Here, you **must** create a new variable. 

You must create a new variable, and you can be assured it is true because you are presuming that some arbitrary variable sustains this equation.
