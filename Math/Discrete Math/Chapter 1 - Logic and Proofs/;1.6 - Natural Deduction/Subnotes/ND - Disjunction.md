### What is the Introduction rule for Disjunction 

![[Pasted image 20220531184354.png]]

If you have ANY propostion, then you can do an $\lor$ introduction, citing the line with the original proposition. 

q does not need to be true. It could be false. But it doesn’t matter. If the premises, except this time this propostion is p, and is true, then we know p $\lor$ q will be true as well, since we only need one of the two propositions to be true. 



### What is the elimination rule for Disjunction

To do an OR elimination, you need to show that either part of the OR statement can give you the same outcome. 

That way, it doesn’t matter if both are not true. At least one will be true since natural deduction reuqires it, and if they both give the same outcome, then it doesn’t really matter.
