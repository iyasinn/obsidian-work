#### Introuduction
Natural Deduction is a special type of **argument**
It only uses 
- Logical symbols rather than English
- Uses a certain set of implication rules 
- makes sure that every step is “valid"
- Parallels the “natural” way you “deduce” things about each operator
- Any natural deduction is just a TAUTOLOGY

**In this class, we don’t use logical equivalences in our natural deduction proofs. **

The ideas of natural deduction are all based on the [[Arguments in Propositional Logic]], and the fact that as long as the premise is true, the conclusion is true. 

Also, ANY STATEMENT WRITTEN DOWN IN NATURAL DEDUCTION IS TRUE. IT IS EQUIVALENT TO TRUE. 

One useful thing to take note of in Natrual Deduction are 
- [[Assumption Boxes]]

[[ND - Conditional]]

[[ND - Negation]]

[[ND - Biconditional]]

[[ND - Exists]]

[[ND - For All]]
