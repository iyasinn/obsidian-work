Natural Deduction is a special type of **argument**
It only uses 
- Logical symbols rather than English
- Uses a certain set of implication rules 
- makes sure that every step is “valid"
- Parallels the “natural” way you “deduce” things about each operator

**In this class, we don’t use logical equivalences in our natural deduction proofs. **

The ideas of natural deduction are all based on the [[Arguments in Propositional Logic]], and the fact that as long as the premise is true, the conclusion is true. 

One useful thing to take note of in Natrual Deduction are 
- [[Assumption Boxes]]

#### Natural Deduction Rules
There is an **introduction** and **elimination** rule for all the logical connectives. All these rules can be proved via a #tautology 

[[ND - Conjunction]]

[[ND - Disjunction]]

[[ND - Conditional]]

[[ND - Negation]]

[[ND - Biconditional]]

[[ND - Exists]]

[[ND - For All]]

[[ND - False]]
