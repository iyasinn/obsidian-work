With a negation introduction, you need to assume a proposition, see if it gives you **false**. If it gives you false, then that means you can presume the negation of that statmement.

This is trivially false
Why? 
Well itâ€™s not really possible to have a propostion and its negation

So if you get this, that means you have **false**
