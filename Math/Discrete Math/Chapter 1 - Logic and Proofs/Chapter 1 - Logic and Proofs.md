### Why is this important? 

Logic and Proofs are the foundations upon which discrete math is built. 
They allow us to understand logical statemetns in mathematics. It lets us proove these things too. 

A corect mathematical argument is called a #proof. Once you prove a statement is true, we can then call it a #theorem. All these theorems are what forma  topic! 

To understand the topic, we need to consistently construct #proofs to understand what we learn!

### The Topics






- Overview
	- ![[Pasted image 20220511021709.png]]




1.1 - [[;1.1 - Propositions]]
We first need to understand propositions, which are basic mathematical statements.

1.2 - [[;1.2 - Applications of Prop Logic]]
We need to be able to take our propositions and put them in english 

1.3 - [[;1.3 - Propositional Equivalence]]
This is incredibly important. We start learning rules that allow us to equate propostions. 

1.4 - [[;1.4 - Predicate Logic]]

1.5 - [[;1.5 - Nested Quantifiers]]

1.6 -  [[;1.6 - Natural Deduction]]

1.7 - [[;1.7 - Introduction to proofs]]


### Tips's
- Double negation, commutative, and associative can all be done in one step together, but write them as steps and label with both!
