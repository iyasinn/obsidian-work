# Mathematical Induction

Mathematical Induction is an incredibly useful technique. You must ensure you master it!

- Note on proof styles
	- Techniques such as those like induction are more so “counting” proofs. So we don’t use logical equivalences to do them, rather we use ideas of “counting” and the reason they work is because of these “counting” ideas.
