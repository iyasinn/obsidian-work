# Why is mathematical induction valid?

Why is mathematical induction valid? Why does it really work? 

We can base this off the “well ordering principle”

#### What is the well ordering property? 
An axiom that states.

***Every nonempty subset of the set of positive integers has a least element***

REMEMBER, it can be for ANY ANY ANY SUBSET, like {5, 6, 7,} or {1, 2, 3, 4,5} etc. 

Note: This is specifically for the set of positive integers. 


#### Prove that induction works using this axiom
![[Induction - Proving Induction works with well ordering principle]]


We could also go the other way and prove the well ordering principle if we use induction as an axionm 

#### So what is the relationship between the well ordering principle and induciton 

They are equivalent 

Well ordering principle for positive integers $\iff$ induction 

Since you can start with either and prove the other is true.
