# Analogy To Mathematical Induction

## Ladder approach
This is meant to be more so of a read only chapter

You can think of mathematical induction as climbing a ladder. 

To prove we can climb this ladder, we need to show two things:
1. Can we reach the first step? 
2. For any step in the ladder, can we guarantee that we’ll reach the next step.

If we can prove these two things are true, then we can climb the ladder. 
Use (1) to show we can reach the first step. Then keep on reapplying (2) to show we can reach every subsequent step. That way, we can continuously climb the ladder.

After 100 uses of (2), we will have reached the 101t step. 

Mathematical induction allows us to use this to conclude that we can infinitely climb this ladder forever! It allows us to conclude this. That we can reach the n’th step of the ladder. 

Once you have a place to start (this is important), you must be able to go to the next spot!

Mathematical induction lets us continuously prove new results!
