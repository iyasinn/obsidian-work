10 questions on the multiple choice test, 4 answers for each

a. 

4^10


(10 * 4^9) + (10 * 9 * 4^8) + (10 * 9 * 8 * 4^7) + (10 * 9 * 8 * 7  * 4^6) 
+(10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 + 4^5) + (10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4^4)  + (10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 4^3) + (10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 4^2) + (10P9 * 4) + (1)

Must start with an A

26^2




# 10


# 11
We know they must begin and end with a 1
It has length 10

So there are 8 digits
This is a bit string

2^8

# 12


# 13
So it’s bit strings with length not exceeding n (and n is a positive integer)
Remember to think about edge cases 

All we have to do is choose a length from 1 to n - 1
So n - 1 choices for the length, and there will always be one string of all 1s for that given legnth

Answer: n - 1

For edge caess, when n = 1, then we have 1 = 1 = 0 strings,which works out




# 14


# 15
Lower case letters of length four or less
So four or three or two or one

We can split into cases

$\sum_{n = 1}^{4}\limits 26^{n} = 26^{1}+ 26^{2}+26^{3}+ 26^4$


# 16


# 17
We see the word at least. This means we have to be careful of double counts

128 ascii characters 

Total length: 128^4
Length with no @ symbol: 127^4

Length with at least one @ symbol: 128^4  - 127^4


OTHER METHODS:
Cases? exactly1 @ symbol. exactly 2 @ symbol…etc. 
We can sum these cases up 


OTHER METHODS:
We could chose 5C1 locations for the @ symbol. Then we can just do 128^4? 
This actually has double counting. 
It gets really ugly cuz what i f we choose position 1 for @ symbol then pos 2 naturally has @ symbol, or what if we have the vice versa case where w choose pos 2 for @ but pos 1 has the symbol instead. It gets really really weird. 

Best not to do this.

RNA contains A, U, C, G
4 potential elements

a 3^6

b. We need GU at the end. We have 5 other elements to order
4^5
INTERESTING: technically this is also the number of sequences with say UU, or AA, or AC….etc….Very cool!

c. 4^5

Start must be a C. Rest can be anything. 

d. 2^6

Only two choices for each spot

# 20


# 21
Is this inclusive or exclusive? 
If inclusive, 51, if exclusive, then 49 integers
I’m assuming exclusive from 50 to 100

a. 
7 integers divisible by 
Divisible by 7
I can just count these tbh 

a. 7
56, 63, 70, 77, 84, 91, 98

b. 5
55, 66, 77, 88, 99

c. 1
This will be the integers that overlap in both sets. 
In this case, only one overlaps, namely, 77
Really we are just taking the union of both counts of the sets

# 22


# 23

a. 
Need a good way to count this. 
New idea: Find the minimum multiple of 7 in the range
7 * 15 = 105
So the 15th multiple of 7 is in the range
7 * 142 = 995

So the 142th multiple of 7 is the last number in the range

142 - 15 + 1 = 128

SO 128 numbers in this range that are divisible by 7

**Thinking about multiples is so so helpful.*

b. 450
The range is inclusive
How many numbers in the range (exclusive range)
900 numbers in the range
Half of them should be odd
So 450 numbers divisible by 2


OTHER METHOD TO BE SAFE:
101 to 998 is going to be 898 numbers, half of those is 449 numbers being odd. This is a simple count definitiive. Then the last odd is 900


c. 9
111, 222, 333, 444, 555, 666, 777, 888, 999
We can just use these three 9 numbers. 

d. 
What if we find all numbers divisible by 4 and then subtract? 

100 is the 25th multiple of 4
996 is the 249th multiple of 4
249-25 = 224 + 1 = 225 multiples in between 

Overall, from 100 to 999, there are 900 numbers, 899 to get to 999, but also include 100

900 - 225 = 675

675 numbers not divisible by 4


e.
900 numbers total 
From the past problem, there are 225 multiples of 4 
For multipls of 3
102 is the 34th multiple of 3
999 is the 333th multiple of 3
333 - 34 + 1 =300 multiple of 3


Since multiples of 3 and 4 include multiples of 12, we need to 
remove all mulitples of 12 

108 is the 9th multiple of 12
996 is the 83rd multiple of 12

83 - 9 + 1 = 75

So 225 + 300 - 75 = 450

**So 450 multiples of 3 or 4**

Not divisible by 3 and not by 4
900 - 450 = 450

450 numbers not divisible by 3 or 4


g. 3 and not 4
numbers div by 12 = 74
BY 3 is 300
300 - 74
126 numbers div by 3 and not 4

h. 
This is just all numbers divisible by 12 (3 and 4 are relatively prime so this is true, we **proved bthis by lemma in class**)
So this wil just be
**75**

Just a string of three decimal digits. 

000 to 999 = 1000 combinations 
OR
10 * 10 * 10 = 1000 combinations

a. 1000 - 9 = 991
Does not containg the same digit 3 times 
9 combinations
9 digits to repeat 3 times

b. 

So can’t begin with an odd digit 
From 0 to 9 there are 5 even digit
So 5 * 10 * 10 = 500   

This is also a bit easy because we know half of the 1000 start with an even number 
5 evens and 5 odd numbers for the start position after all


c. 20

Need exactly 2 digits that are 4
So we need 2 digits that are 4
Now we have to order them
Task to order: 2 ways to do this
Last digit: 10 ways to do so 

2 * 10 = 20

(26^2 + 26^3) * (10^2 * 10^3)

**You can add your choices like this when you have multiple of them **

26 letters
5 vowels
21 consonants

a. 21^8

b. 21 * 20 * 19 * 18 * 19 * 17 * 16 * 15 = 21P8

c. 21^8

d. 21P7

e. 26^8 - 21^8
Total combinations
26^8
No vowels 
21^8


f. 26^6

g. 26^4 
Start and ending positions are taken up 
**really this is just a calculation of how many options there are when the start and ending positions are in general taken up by any string of characters**

h. 26^6 - 21^6
So for 6 letters
26^6 opportunities
21^6 with no vowels

So 26^6 - 21^6

What are the requirements of one to one? 
A one to one function maps every input to one output
or f(x) = f(y) → x = y
We can go through the inputs and decrease the number of outputs

a. 0 functions. No such function is possible since 5 > 4
5 elements to 4 elements

b. 5! functions. 
Task: Map intput to output
T1: 5
T2: 4
… decreasing because ahs t opmap to unique output

c. 6
6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2
Aka 6P5
The way I’m thinking is we’ve layed the potential outputs in order and are selecting them
Hence a permuation with ordering is important

d. 7P5

# 36


# 37

a. 0. Domain larger than the codomain 
b. 2^(n - 2)

Come back to this

# 41

2^((2n + 1) / 2)

So for a palindrome when you reverse it’s the exact same
So when we form a string of length n 
We need the numbers to be the same

For now let’s split into cases
Btw these are bit strings

Even case:
So we can only choose up to the n/2th digit. After that, it’s already picked. 
2^(n/2)

Odd case:
We can choose up to the floor(n/2) digit, and then we can choose the next middle number. THer est is the reverse
2^((n - 1) / 2) * 2 = 2^((n+1)/2)

Add all the case

2^(n/2) + (2^((n+1)/2)) = 2^((2n + 1)/2)

RNA has AUGC

Tbh, this is saying has at least one U
Total combinations: 4^4 = 2^8 = 256

a. 256 - 81 = 175
Sequences without U = 81


b. 248
Looking at those with CUG 
Can have 2 spots, and then any other
2 * 4 = 8
256 - 8 = 248

c. 256 - 4! = 256 - 24 = 232
Might not contain one thing, two thing, or 3 things
Let’s say it contains all of them
4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 4! =24

# 44


# 45 

40 sections

434 freshmen
883 sophomores
43 juniors

Each section has 34 students 

434 + 883 + 43 = 1360
To get a section, we need 34 students, so we can divide by 34
1360/34 = 40

six people around a circular table
If two people have the same neighbor on the left and right, then it is the same

So I think we can rotate 
So if we stretch out the table
It’s 
6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 6!

Ways to place them when ordering around the table

But since we can rotate and have an identical seating, we divide by 6 to get rid of extras
6!/6 = 5!

5! seatings

# 48


# 49
a. 2 * 5!

SO the bride and groom must be next to each other
If we treat them as one object, then we have to order them. 2 ways to order them. 

b. 6! = (2 * 5!) 
6! orderings
2 * 5! with bride and groom together

c. (2 * 1 + 3 * 2 + 4 * 3 + 5 * 4 + 6 * 5) * 4!
The groom can’t be in position 1
For position 2, there is one spot for the bride
Position 3, there are 2 spots
For any position, n - 1 spots

So first order groom and bride in cases

Then order the other 4 people for those cases

2^8 + 2^7 - 2^5

Bit strings can start with 0 
Start with 3 0s. 2^7
End with 2 0s. 2^8
Start with 3 0s and end with 2 0s: 2^5

2^7 + 2^8 - 2^5

# 52

# 53
Bit string of length 8
2^8 total combinations

We need to do cases for three zeros
three zeros will be added to a bit string of 5 digits 
Let’s do cases for consecutive zeros
All 1s: 6 places to add

One zero: 5 * 6 / 2 = 15
5 spots for the zero, 6 to add stuff, and divide by 2 since 2 ways to get same output

Two zero: 4 * 6 / 3 = 8
4 spots for two zeros (think about where the first zero can go), 6 to add sequence, and divide by 3 since 3 ways to get that solution

Three zero: 3 * 6 / 4 = 18/4
Three spots for three zeros, 6 places to add the sequence, and then divide by 4 since 4 ways to get same output with three zeros

Four zero: 2 * 6 / 5 = 12/5

Five zero: 2 * 6 / 6 = 2

If we add these all up, we should get all combinations of sequences of three zeros (we’re always adding three zeros)

12

Divisible by 4: 
100 / 4 = 20 
So 20 integers, aka 100 is the 20th multiple of 4

Note: We say positive integers, and from 1 to 100, 100 positivie integers

100 / 6 = 16.67, so 16 integers from 1 to 100, aka the 16th multiple of 6 is 96

Now we need to take the union

But how to find all integers divisible by 4 and 6? 

A number is divisible by 6 if an donly if it is divislby e by 3 and 2
A number is divisible by 3 if and only if all its digits are divisible by 3

So let’s look at 4 and 3
To do that it must be divisible by 12
8 digits
12 24 36 48 60 72 84 96
So we got ALL the numbers divisible by 3 and 4
We know we haven’t missed any because if there was a number here that is divisible by 6, then that means it isn’t divisilbe by 3, which isn’t possible

20 + 16 - 8 = 12

68 types of characters

8 - 12 characters allowed 

a. 68^12 + 68^11 + 68^10 + 68^9 + 68^8 = $\sum\limits_{n = 8}^{12}[68^8]$

b. $\sum\limits_{n = 8}^{12}[68^8]$ - $\sum\limits_{n = 8}^{12}[62^8]$

No special occurrence: $\sum\limits_{n = 8}^{12}[62^8]$

c. Roughly 314,582 years

$\sum\limits_{n = 8}^{12}[68^{8}]$ nanoseconds = 314,582.4245 years 

# 59
1 to 65,535 characters, inclusive
So 65,535 characters
26 lowercase, 26 uppercase, 2 special, 10 digits, and first character can’t be a digit
64 characters

$\sum\limits_{n = 1}^{65535}[54 * 64^{n - 1}]$

I think hexa decimal is 16 digits

16^6 + 16^26 + 16^58


Divisible by 4: 10^6 / 4 = (5 * 2)^6 / 2^2 = 2^6 * 5^6 / 2^2 = 2^4 * 5^6 = 250,000

So 750,000 not divisible by 4

Divisible by 6: 10^6 / 6 = 166,666

Divisible by 4 AND 6: 

If divisible by 6, then divisible by 3 and divisible by 2 
So 10^6 / 3 = 333,333
Get rid of 3, so 333, 332 
And divide by 2 to get 166, 666 even integers 

If divisible by 4, then the last
