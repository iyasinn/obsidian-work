# Chapter 6 - Counting Overview
 
---
## Introduction

Counting is an integral part of mathematics! It will help you to solve many types of problems! 

It consists of:
- Basic rules of counting that are essential to understand!
- Enumeration: The counting of objects with certain properties.
- Pigeonhole principle: n + 1 pigeons and n boxes means at least two pigeons **must** share a box!
- Permutations and combinations
