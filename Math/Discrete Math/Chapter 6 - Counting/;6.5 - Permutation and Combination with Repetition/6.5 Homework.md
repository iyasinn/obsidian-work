three jobs
5 employees

Each employee can have more than one job 
So how total outcomes? 
one way for 3 jobs
3 choose 2 ways for 2 jobs so 3
3 ways for one job
7 ways for an employee to be employed 

**DONT OVERCOMPLICATE**

THERE ARE ONLY 3 jobs 
Bruh I thought more than one person could have a job

set of 3 elements from a set of five elements with repetition 
This is like balls and bars
5 types, 3 balls have to be distributed into the types

(3 + 5 - 1)C(3) = 7C3 = 35

8 types of bagels


a. (6 + 8 -1)C(6) = C(13, 6)
Choose 6 bagels
Repetition allowed, and it’s unordered, just use balls and bars

b. (12 + 8 - 1) C(12) C(19, 12)

c. C(24 + 8 - 1, 12) = C(31, 12)

d. C(4+8-1, 4) = C(11, 4)
We need 12 bagels. We need 1 of each kind, so we can just say we only have a choice over 12-8=4 bagels.

e. 3289 ways

At least three egg bagels and no more than two salty bagels. 
Firstly, at least three egg bagels, so that means 3 bagels taken up

So we have 12-3=9 bagels to choose with

Now total number of placements like this would be 
C(9 + 8 - 1, 9) = C(15, 9)
Now of these remainign combinations, we need to find the ones where we have at most 2 salty bagels. 
Well this is just the complement of at least 3 salty bagels
C(6+8-1, 6) = C(13, 6)

C(15, 9) - C(13,6) = 3289

**Made a silly mistake , its’ 16 chooose 9 not 15 choose 9**

**Good methodolgy presented here when you have at most a certain type of element though. **

**Overall, when we have requirements a AND b, we can focus on each requirement. But if we have an OR, then we need to focus on each requirement and use the INCLUSION EXCLUSION PRINCIPLE **

So we have 100 identical pennies and 80 identical nickels

So really we have to choose a set of coins where a coin can be either a penny or a nickel

We’ll never run out of either option 

So choosing from a set of 2 objects with repetition and we need 8
So choosing a set of 8 objects each of type nickel of penny

C(8 + 2 - 1, 8) = C(9, 8)


![[Pasted image 20220810170853.png]]

We just need to choose them. So answer is 9 because we can shoe 9 pennies, 8, 7….0….so 9. Replacing each time with nickels. 

Remember, we are CHOOSING a SET. 

**Remember you can also use common sense**
**Also note that here we can assume we never run out of coins…isnce we have way more than 8 coins of each type, **

Each copy is the same
Each warehouse is different 
We could distinguish each book by which warehouse theyre in

So balls and bars

A solution like this is really just picking 5 numbers from a set of 21 

So we have 21 integers, and each can be placed in one of 5 categories. 

a. 24C4 = 24C20
One must be from x1, so we have 20 integers
So (20 + 5 - 1)C(20) = 24C4

b. 15C11
All must be have at least 2, so 10 integers taken up, 11 remaining.
(11 + 5 - 1) C (11)
(15)C11

c. 25C21 - 14C10 Correct :)
So must be from 1 to 10 
Don’t overcomplicate. Look at if x1 ≥ 11
Then we know at least 11 numbers used up 
SO 10 remaining
14C10

And without any restriction
25C21

Note, all the numbers are nonnegative, the 0 has a 0 chance of occurring. 

d. 

Total is 21
x3 ≥ 15

So 6 remaining integers

(6 + 5 - 1) C (6)
10 C 6 = 210 

x2 ≤ 3 and x1 ≤ 3
Negation: x2 ≥ 4 or x1 ≥ 4

cant have both of these because then x1 ≥4 and  x2 ≥ 4 too large
WLOG
If 4 are taken up, then we have 2 remaining integers
(2 + 5 - 1) C (2) = 6 C 2
Two cases so do this twice: 
2 * 6 C 2 = 30



310 - 30 = 180

**I missed an extra case. Remember, we are dealing with nonnegative integers**
That case is that x2 = 0, since that is still counted in.
This is a bit tough because we still have the rule that x1 at most is 3 
So we really need x1 ≤ 3 AND x2 = 0 subtracted, aka inclusion exclusision principle 

Negation
x1 ≥ 3 or x2 != 0
x1 ≥ 3 or x2 ≥ 1
x1 ≥4 is just 6 C 2

6 integers to use up 

x2 ≥ 1 is just (5 + 5 - 1)C(5) = 9C5



Overlap is gonna be that 5 are used up, so 1 remaining (1 + 5 - 1)C2) = 5C1
6C2 + 9C5 - 5C1 = 136 

Thisis the cases of x! ≤ 3


144










---

Solving it thru the same method as solutions


**Big lesson: we can break up even compound inequalities since they are just AND statements, don’t overcomplicate**

X3 ≥ 15 and x2 ≥ 1 can be dealt with first 
So we get 
21 - 16 = 5 integers left

(5 + 5 - 1) c 5 = C(9, 5) ways to currently count

Now for the next constraints
We had 1 ≤ x2 ≤ 3
0 ≤ x1 ≤ 3
Since we used up 1 integer for x2 already, we really have to look at x2 ≤ 2
because it’s maximum has now changed
x1 ≤ 3 
x2 ≤ 2

x1 ≥ 4 is going to be (1 + 5 - 1)C(1) = 5C1
x2 ≥ 3 is going to be (2 + 5 - 1)C(2) = 6C2

9C5 - 5 - 6C2
126 - 5 - 15
126 - 20 = 106

106

**BIG LESSON: THE BOUNDS CAN CHANGE FOR YOUR INEQUALITIES IN THESE PROBLEMS, ESPECIALLY AFTER YOU ALREADY SUBJECT THE EQUATION TO SOME RULE. **

VERY VERY VERY GOOD PROBLEM

10! / (2! * 3! * 5!)

CORRECT :D
Nothign left over




0, 1, or 2 for each of the 10 digits

We can think of this is ordering distinct locations into distinct boxes with exact types


# 18


# 19
14!/(3! * 3! * 2! * 2! * 2!)

2 sets of triplets
3 sets of twins
and 2 kids     


Need to seat the kids in a row 

We have 14! orderings, but then can move around the identical kids

a. 13^2
b. 13P2 
Or 13 * 12
One color for left, one of the others for the right shoe. 
Doesn’t exclude any options. 

c. How many ways to pick two colors? 13C2

d. 
So we can pick two colors but there can be repetition 
two ways
Balls and bars: (13 - 1 + 2) C 2 = 14C2 = 91

OR

13C2 = 78 ways to pick a set of two different colors
13 pairs of same color
78 + 13 = 91 :)

---





13 pairs of shoes


a. 13^2 = 169
Or 13

b.
13 * 12
DONT OVERCOMPLICATE BRUV 


**BETTER METHOD**
Need to take 13 permute 2, since the ordering matters
Note that permutations are WITHOUT REPALCEMENT 
So any two colors without replacment


Wrong , must be 156

Or maybe

(13 - 1 + 2)C(2) - 13 = 14C2 - 13





c. 13C2 = 78

d. 91

So before which color is on which foot mattered 
But now lets think about it, which color is on which foot doesn’t matter, that let  us do 13C2 to get 78, when the co,ors must be different

Just add 13, to get 91

C(14, 9)

Six unlabeled balls into 9 labeled bins

Sum of digits must be 19 

Each digit is less than or equal to 9
So 10 options for each digit 

5 digit numbers 
4 digit numbers


3 digit numbers 
(19 + 3 - 1) C (19) = C(21, 19) = 210
d1 ≤ 9
d2 ≤ 9
d3 ≤ 9

d1 ≥ 10 or d2 ≥ 10 or d3 ≥ 10
Can never have an INTERSECTION because otherwise the sum would be larger than 19

At least 10 in a digit means 10 chosen, so 9 left, so (9 + 3 - 1)C(9)=(11C9)
Three of these
11C9 * 3 = 165

210 - 165 = 45

General purpose solution
$\sum\limits_{i=3}^{5}[C(18+i, 19) - i * C(8 + i, 9)]$



2 digit numbers: 0
1 digit numbers: 0


**I was close but I should have just stuck to 6 digits **

But actually IM RIGHT
I need to make the upper bound of my sumation 6
and then Im right
$\sum\limits_{i=3}^{6}[C(18+i, 19) - i * C(8 + i, 9)] = 36477$
WAIT NOT IM OFF :(

Just use 6 digits, since they can be 0 as well, which means no digit there. Much easier to do it like this.

Need to assign scores
Each question is worth at least 5 points, so 50 points used up

50 points need to be distributed to 10 questions
(50 + 10 - 1) C (50) = 59C50 = 50C9

Really we are distributing 50 points across any 10 questions

**Used perfect reasoning**
**Remember to think conceptually about what we’re dealing with and what needs to be measured. **

strung must begin with a 1, so ignore that in the count, just assume it’s true

Need 3 1 bits, need 12 0 bits, and each 1 bit needs to be followed by at least 2 0 bits

SO need to start with 100
And need three additional 100

So four 100
In between these four 100, we can place the remaining 0 needed, which is 4 zero, since we used up 8, and now have four left. 
Can’t place 0s before the first 1, so in the remaining four gaps we can place 0s 

4 objects
4 - 1 bars 
(4 + 4 - 1) C (4) = 7C4 = 35


![[Pasted image 20220810183825.png]]
The second method is pretty good. Essentially very similar to what I already did. 
Actually the first method is more in line with what I did. The second method is neat though. We use up 6 0s, leaving 6 left. 
We place the first 100, then place the remainign 6 zeros. 

We have 7 gaps that could be used, and need to place 3 100s into those 7 gaps. Just choose 7 gaps. Very goo dmethod. :D

Ohw ait
it isn’t about gaps
Just string spaces in general
Nvm

still neat though 









# 32


# 33
11! / (5! * 2! * 2!)
We have 11 letters
11! orderings
5 A
2 B
2 R

So 11! / (5! * 2! * 2!)

Since we can order around those 5 A and get the same output

# 34


# 35

56 substrings 

So we can use some or all of the letters
We could just do cases tbh, or, even better, we could select permutations
5 total letters
The issue is that in the case of choosing one letter, we won’t always have repeats. 

**So the multinomial thing only works when we’re guaranteed to use all of the letters.** 
Then we can guranttee we have 3 os that are indistinguihsiable.


Using some means we can’t use 0:
1 length string: 3 unique letters
2 length string: 5P2 - ()


5!/3!  = 20 ways to permute the 5 letters
2 * (4! / 3!) + 4!/2!  = 20 ways to permute 4 letters

3! + (2 * 3!/2!) + (1) = 6 + 6 + 1 = 13 ways to permute 3 letters

1 + 3P2 = 7 ways to permute 2 letters

3 ways to have 1 letters

**SPLITTING INTO SUBSTRINGS WAS A GOOD IDEA **
**However I massively undercounted the number of substrings. **

20+20+13+2+1
56 substrings




# 36


# 37

9 letters
4 Es, 2 Rs
9!/(4! * 2!)

Note: 3 remaining letters. 

8 letters
We need to do cases likely 
Since we have 3 extra letters, we need to be able to add up to  8 each time

4 Es and 2Rs and 2 letters:  3 * 8! / (4! * 2!) = 840 * 3 = 2520
Need to choose the letter that is left out, don’t do 3 * 2 because that does overcounting. 

4Es and 1R and 3 letters: 3 * 2 * 1 * 8!/4! = 
3Es and 2Rs and 3 letters: 3  * 2 * 1 * 8!/(3! * 2!)


**My method was correct but I need to be careful of overcounting. **


# 38
14C6

6 1s, and 8 0s
Bit string of length 14. We just need to choose 6 locations for the 1, or 8 locations for the 0 of the total number of bit elements. 

14C6

OR

We can do multinomial
14!/(6! * 8!)
Positions need to be distributed into groups of type 1 or type 0
Or we can think of it as making a sequence of 14 elements where there are 6 1s and 8 0s and so we divide to account for overcounting

Each player needs 7 cards

52!/(7! * 7! * 7! * 7! * 7! * 17!)

Interesting because we order 52 cards
then divide out 7 from first 5, 7 from second 5, 7 from next 5 etc. 
Which should give us unique orderings 

I wonder if we should dividing out 17! for the remainign last cards. 
we should

**So when ordering n objects where n into k groups where each group has ean exactly cardinality i such that ALL the groups cardinality adds up to the desired output**

**But if not, then you have to divide out the remaining opotions, because the way it works is through orderings**

**ANother perspective is that we are groupiong out what doesn’t matter**

# 44


# 45
48!/(5!^6 * 18!)

**good to multioply out the group of cards not chosen :p**

n books on k shelves

a. (n + k - 1)C(n)
We can just use balls and bars here, since the books are identical




b. 
Since no two books are the same and the positioning on the shelves matters
We can just look at 

(n + k - 1)C(n)
This gives all the ways to put n books on k shelves
For any given way to do so, we have k! ways we can order them on those shelves. 

So (n + k - 1)P(n) = (n + k -1)C(n) * n!
Since we’re now just choosing the positiions and we’re ordering in those positions, and the ordering actually matters, and no double counting because all books are different.

**My way also works very well it seems**

n C n1 to place in the first box
n - n1 C n2 to place in the second box…..
n - n1 - n2 - n3 - n4 ….. C nk
Is the same as nk C nk to place in the last box

This gives us 
n!/(n1! * n2! * n3! * n4!*)

**Just need to use combinations here**

So four used up, then 2 remaining. So we can have a box with 3 objects, or two boxes with two objects.

Each box has one ball in it

a.

boxes labeled

So we know each box has exactly one ball in it 
We can do a case where one box has 3 balls, and the rest have one
Need to choose which box has 3 balls. 
3 * 5! / 3!  = 60
3 * 5C3 * 2 = 60 as well 



Case where one box has 2 balls, another has 2 balls, and the rest have one
3C2 * 5!/(2! * 2!) = 90

3C2 * 5C4 * 3 * 2 = 90
Or think about it fro the perspective of the ONE ball 
5C1 * 3C1 * 3 * 2 
One ball, 3 boxes to go in, 3 groups of 2, and 2 ways to place each 2 gorups of 2






90 + 60 = 150 ways

Needs to visit five sites twice 
One site each day, so 10 days, 10 visitations
Can’t visit site x on a consecutive day 

The way I’d do it is first find total ways to do this 

10! / (2!^5) = 113, 400     because 5 pairs of 2 indistinguishable days. 

Now how about if we group the two XX together. We now have 9 visitations total, 1 normal, and the 4 pairs of same days. 

9! / (2!^4 * 1!) = 22680

113, 400 - 22,680 = 90, 720 ways.
