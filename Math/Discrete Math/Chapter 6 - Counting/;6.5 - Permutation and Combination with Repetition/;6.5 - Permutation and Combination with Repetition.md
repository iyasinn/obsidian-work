# 6.5 Generalized Permutations and Combinations With Repetition

[[Chapter 6 - Counting]]

---
Certain counting problems have issues that canâ€™t always be solved with [[;6.3 - Permutations and Combinations|Permutations and Combinations]] 

Some of these issues are:
- Repetition of objects. Using some object, like a letter or number, multiple times. 
- Indistinguishable objects. Before, objects were distinguishable, but some objects might be the same, which causes over counting. 
- Placing distinguishable elements into boxes.

Note, you need to COMBINE all the below techniques to gain a better understanding. Each technique is not its own separate thing.

[[Permutations with Indistinguishable Objects]]

Now we can generalize these concepts
- We can think of solving some problems as placing some objects into boxes. This will line up with:
	- Combinations with repetition: This is like defining the values of our objects, which is like placing them into boxes. 
	- Permutations with indistinguishable objects: So here, each indistinguishable type will be a box, which MUST have a certain number of elements. Then we can place positions into these boxes to place each object. This is how it relates to objects being placed into boxes.
