# 11
We know they must begin and end with a 1
It has length 10

So there are 8 digits
This is a bit string

2^8

# 12


# 13 ❌
So it’s bit strings with length not exceeding n (and n is a positive integer)
Remember to think about edge cases 

All we have to do is choose a length from 1 to n - 1
So n - 1 choices for the length, and there will always be one string of all 1s for that given legnth

Answer: n - 1

For edge caess, when n = 1, then we have 1 = 1 = 0 strings,which works out

Not exceeding = at most 
So max is n length 
They have to consist entirely of 1s 
n = 3
1
11
111

**The empty bit string doesn’t consist of 0s. It consists of NOTHING. IT IS A STRING AFTER ALL, AND STRINGS HAVE STUFF OR THEY DONT. DONT MIX BIT STRINGS WITH BIT DIGITS.**

**So does the empty bit string consist of only 1s? yes, since it has nothing else**
$\forall x \in S [x = 1]$
Since there are no elements in S, this is vacuously true. 


So n + 1 strings, as we include the empty string. 


# 14


# 15
Lower case letters of length four or less
So four or three or two or one

We can split into cases

$\sum_{n = 1}^{4}\limits 26^{n} = 26^{1}+ 26^{2}+26^{3}+ 26^4$

⭐
**Be careful of whether you need to count the empty string or not. **

# 16


# 17
We see the word at least. This means we have to be careful of double counts

128 ascii characters 

Total length: 128^5
Length with no @ symbol: 127^5

Length with at least one @ symbol: 128^5  - 127^5


OTHER METHODS:
Cases? exactly1 @ symbol. exactly 2 @ symbol…etc. 
We can sum these cases up 


OTHER METHODS:
We could chose 5C1 locations for the @ symbol. Then we can just do 128^4? 
This actually has double counting. 
It gets really ugly cuz what i f we choose position 1 for @ symbol then pos 2 naturally has @ symbol, or what if we have the vice versa case where w choose pos 2 for @ but pos 1 has the symbol instead. It gets really really weird. 

Best not to do this.

Is this inclusive or exclusive? 
If inclusive, 51, if exclusive, then 49 integers
I’m assuming exclusive from 50 to 100

**Endpoint is moot since neither 50 not 100 divisible by 7 anyway. **

**GOod way to do this is find 100 / 7 and then 50 / 7 then subtract** 
⭐

a. 
7 integers divisible by 
Divisible by 7
I can just count these tbh 

a. 7
56, 63, 70, 77, 84, 91, 98

b. 5
55, 66, 77, 88, 99

c. 1
This will be the integers that overlap in both sets. 
In this case, only one overlaps, namely, 77
Really we are just taking the union of both counts of the sets

# 22


# 23

**We can apply counting principles to numbers, as a way to build them up**
How many even numbers are there less than 1000
10 for first spot (we can have 0), 10 for second, 5 for last 
10 * 10 * 5 = 500

a. 
Need a good way to count this. 
New idea: Find the minimum multiple of 7 in the range
7 * 15 = 105
So the 15th multiple of 7 is in the range
7 * 142 = 995

So the 142th multiple of 7 is the last number in the range

142 - 15 + 1 = 128

SO 128 numbers in this range that are divisible by 7

**Thinking about multiples is so so helpful.*

b. 450
The range is inclusive
How many numbers in the range (exclusive range)
900 numbers in the range
Half of them should be odd
So 450 numbers divisible by 2


OTHER METHOD TO BE SAFE:
101 to 998 is going to be 898 numbers, half of those is 449 numbers being odd. This is a simple count definitiive. Then the last odd is 900


c. 9
111, 222, 333, 444, 555, 666, 777, 888, 999
We can just use these three 9 numbers. 

d. 
What if we find all numbers divisible by 4 and then subtract? 

100 is the 25th multiple of 4
996 is the 249th multiple of 4
249-25 = 224 + 1 = 225 multiples in between 

Overall, from 100 to 999, there are 900 numbers, 899 to get to 999, but also include 100

900 - 225 = 675

675 numbers not divisible by 4


e.
900 numbers total 
From the past problem, there are 225 multiples of 4 
For multipls of 3
102 is the 34th multiple of 3
999 is the 333th multiple of 3
333 - 34 + 1 =300 multiple of 3


Since multiples of 3 and 4 include multiples of 12, we need to 
remove all mulitples of 12 

108 is the 9th multiple of 12
996 is the 83rd multiple of 12

83 - 9 + 1 = 75

So 225 + 300 - 75 = 450

**So 450 multiples of 3 or 4**

Not divisible by 3 and not by 4
900 - 450 = 450

450 numbers not divisible by 3 or 4


g. 3 and not 4 ❌

300 divisible by 3
For divisible by 12
75 divisible by 12

300 - 75 = 225

numbers div by 12 = 74
BY 3 is 300
300 - 74
126 numbers div by 3 and not 4

h. 
This is just all numbers divisible by 12 (3 and 4 are relatively prime so this is true, we **proved bthis by lemma in class**)
So this wil just be
**75**

Just a string of three decimal digits. 
Stirngs can start with 0 

000 to 999 = 1000 combinations 
OR
10 * 10 * 10 = 1000 combinations

a. 1000 - 9 = 991
Does not containg the same digit 3 times 
9 combinations
9 digits to repeat 3 times
0 is also a digit
000
so 10 not 9

1000 - 10 = 990

b. 

So can’t begin with an odd digit 
From 0 to 9 there are 5 even digit
So 5 * 10 * 10 = 500   

This is also a bit easy because we know half of the 1000 start with an even number 
5 evens and 5 odd numbers for the start position after all


c. 20

Need exactly 2 digits that are 4
So we need 2 digits that are 4
Now we have to order them
Task to order: 2 ways to do this

What are the requirements of one to one? 
A one to one function maps every input to one output
or f(x) = f(y) → x = y
We can go through the inputs and decrease the number of outputs

a. 0 functions. No such function is possible since 5 > 4
5 elements to 4 elements

b. 5! functions. 
Task: Map intput to output
T1: 5
T2: 4
… decreasing because ahs t opmap to unique output

c. 
6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2
Aka 6P5
The way I’m thinking is we’ve layed the potential outputs in order and are selecting them
Hence a permuation with ordering is important

**Here I made an arbitrary ordering, which is OK**

⭐

**THINK ABOUT ALL THE CASES**
This is 2 * (n - 1)
We have to assign 1 to any of the values LESS THAN N
N itself can be ANYTHING

2^((2n + 1) / 2)

So for a palindrome when you reverse it’s the exact same
So when we form a string of length n 
We need the numbers to be the same

For now let’s split into cases
Btw these are bit strings

Even case:
So we can only choose up to the n/2th digit. After that, it’s already picked. 
2^(n/2)

Odd case:
We can choose up to the floor(n/2) digit, and then we can choose the next middle number. THer est is the reverse
2^((n - 1) / 2) * 2 = 2^((n+1)/2)

Add all the case

2^(n/2) + (2^((n+1)/2)) = 2^((2n + 1)/2)


**WRONG. ** THIS WOULD WORK IF SAID WE HAD n EVENS and say n1 odds, but no, that’s not the case. WE NEED ONE SPECIFIC FUNCTION THAT CAN HELP US DEDUCE THIS. I TWILL USE FLOOR/CEIL FUNCTIONS>

**REMEMBER< the FLOOR AND CEIL FUNCTIONS ARE REALLY HELPFUL IN ODD EVEN CASES WHERE THE OUTCOME MUST BE THE SAME **

40 sections

434 freshmen
883 sophomores
43 juniors

Each section has 34 students 

434 + 883 + 43 = 1360
To get a section, we need 34 students, so we can divide by 34
1360/34 = 40

six people around a circular table
If two people have the same neighbor on the left and right, then it is the same

So I think we can rotate 
So if we stretch out the table
It’s 
6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 6!

Ways to place them when ordering around the table

But since we can rotate and have an identical seating, we divide by 6 to get rid of extras
6!/6 = 5!

5! seatings\
And since left and right are the same, we can say 5!/2


# 48


# 49
a. 2 * 5!

SO the bride and groom must be next to each other
If we treat them as one object, then we have to order them. 2 ways to order them. 

b. 6! = (2 * 5!) 
6! orderings
2 * 5! with bride and groom together

c. (2 * 1 + 3 * 2 + 4 * 3 + 5 * 4 + 6 * 5) * 4!
The groom can’t be in position 1
For position 2, there is one spot for the bride
Position 3, there are 2 spots
For any position, n - 1 spots

So first order groom and bride in cases

Then order the other 4 people for those cases

**HARD QUESTION. VERY VERY GOOD**
Bit string of length 8
2^8 total combinations

We need to do cases for three zeros
three zeros will be added to a bit string of 5 digits 
Let’s do cases for consecutive zeros
All 1s: 6 places to add

One zero: 5 * 6 / 2 = 15
5 spots for the zero, 6 to add stuff, and divide by 2 since 2 ways to get same output

Two zero: 4 * 6 / 3 = 8
4 spots for two zeros (think about where the first zero can go), 6 to add sequence, and divide by 3 since 3 ways to get that solution

Three zero: 3 * 6 / 4 = 18/4
Three spots for three zeros, 6 places to add the sequence, and then divide by 4 since 4 ways to get same output with three zeros

Four zero: 2 * 6 / 5 = 12/5

Five zero: 2 * 6 / 6 = 2

If we add these all up, we should get all combinations of sequences of three zeros (we’re always adding three zeros)

12

Divisible by 4: 
100 / 4 = 25
So 20 integers, aka 100 is the 20th multiple of 4

Note: We say positive integers, and from 1 to 100, 100 positivie integers

100 / 6 = 16.67, so 16 integers from 1 to 100, aka the 16th multiple of 6 is 96

Now we need to take the union

But how to find all integers divisible by 4 and 6? 

A number is divisible by 6 if an donly if it is divislby e by 3 and 2
A number is divisible by 3 if and only if all its digits are divisible by 3

So let’s look at 4 and 3
To do that it must be divisible by 12
8 digits
12 24 36 48 60 72 84 96
So we got ALL the numbers divisible by 3 and 4
We know we haven’t missed any because if there was a number here that is divisible by 6, then that means it isn’t divisilbe by 3, which isn’t possible

25 + 16 - 8 = 12

**16^58 contributes the most to this, since it is the largest**


# 65

Answer: **13**

Bit string of length 4 with NO consecutive 3 0s

So total number of bit string is 2^4

Two spots with 3 0s allowed
The other bit digit is going to be 1 or a 0
If a 1, then there are 2 ways
If a 0, then while there are 2 ways, those 2 ways are equivalent, so we divide by 2 to get 1

2 + 1 = 3

2^4 - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13

Another method:
2 spots for 3 zeros
2 options for remaining digit 
two ways to get 4 zeros, so we can subtract one of those ways out
2 * 2 - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3
Or
(2 * 1) + 1 = 3








# 67

**18 ways**

a, b, c, d
4 letters
a CANNOT be followed by b
Firstly, 4! ways to order these in general
if A is FOLLOWED by b

Then 3 spots to put a, and for rest of letters, 2! ways to order them 
SO 3 * 2! = 6 orderings


4! = 24

24 - 6 = 18


Another way 
3 spots for a where it is followed by something
2 things it can be followed by 
then 2! for remaining choices
3 * 2 * 2! = 12
Then if a is last, then 3! ways to order other stuff
So 6 ways 

12 + 6 = 18

{3, 7, 9, 11, 24}

2^5 subsets

Sum of the subset must be less than 28



For everything we have the subset of itself, so that’s 5 subsets
Empty subset is also less than 28, so that’s 1 

We will go from larger to smaller, only considering smaller numbers, which should help get all cases. 


24: Adding only 3 works, so that’s 1

11: 
- Adding any works, so that’s 3, Adding any two works (ordering don’t matter), so that’s also 3, adding any three doesn’t work

9: Adding any works, so that’s 2, adding any two works, so that’s 1, 


FORGOT TO TOD THE CASE WITH 7 I THINK 

3: Nothing to add left over

So 
1 + 5 + 1 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 16 

16 subsets, aka 2^4 subsets

(n^2/4) ways for the second round to go 

2^n * (n^2)/4

n/2 ppl left

Then for the third round, we need some ppl to lose some to win, so 2^(n/2) again
And then (n/4) * (n/4) = (n/4)^2    ways to pair up in the second rouind 
2^(n/2) * (n/4)^2

We keep on doing this until we reach a round with 2 ppl who kept on winning. To make this go as fast as possible, we can two rounds where one dude just loses over and over, so 2 ways to do this
