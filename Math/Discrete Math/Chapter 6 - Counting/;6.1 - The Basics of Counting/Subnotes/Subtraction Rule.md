[[Basic Counting Principles]]

---

The subtraction rule is considered the opposite of the sum rule. 


## Notes

It is also known as the principle of inclusion-exclusion

It can also be used when we count something that we don’t desire, so we can remove it in this manner.

You don’t always have to use it for when you add two sets

For example, if we find n1 * n2 ways to do something, but then decide that one of the ways is invalid, we can do n1 * n2 - 1


### Explain it for sets 

So when we take the union of two non disjoint sets we will have to subtract the overlap.

Or another way is just thinking about how you might have a set of choices, but some of those choices shouldn’t be part of the set, so you can remove the set that contains those choices

so A is your set of choices
B is the subset of A that shouldn’t be in A

A - B will get rid of all those sets
