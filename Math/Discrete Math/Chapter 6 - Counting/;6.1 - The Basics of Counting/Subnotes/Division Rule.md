The division rule is particularly useful when you have multiple ways to get one distinct object. 

So if you have n desired distinct objects, but your total count has k ways to get the n desired objects, then count / k = n 

### Explain it in terms of sets

So to get the n sets we have to divide by d since they all have d elements, and weâ€™re assuming the d elements are unique for each since the subsets are disjoint.
