So if we can break a procedure down into multiple tasks, such as choosing some letter m times, then if we can see how many ways there are to do **each** task, then we can multiply them together to get the total number of ways to do the given task. 

Note the big idea is to **break a task down**!
Take a big problem and make it smaller and smaller! :D



### Explain how the product rule can be thought of for sets?

It can be thought of taking the Cartesian product of sets, and the size of the Cartesian product is the count we get from applying the product rule.

Here, we have (n)(n-1)(n-2)…(n - (m - 1))

The reason we go to m - 1 and not n - m  is because we are subtracting the number of elements that can be mapped to. n - m tells us that m elements from the inputs have mapped to some element in the output

So n - (m - 1) was the last element to get mapped to 

Just note that you have to be careful with the bounds.
