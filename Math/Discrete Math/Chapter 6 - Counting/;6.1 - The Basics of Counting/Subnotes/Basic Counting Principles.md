# Basic Counting Principles

[[;6.1 - The Basics of Counting]]



---

There are two main rules 
- [[Product Rule Counting]]
- [[Sum Rule Counting]]

There are also some counter rules. These are the opposite of the product/sum rules. 
- [[Subtraction Rule]]
- [[Division Rule]]

### Do problems only use the sum rule or product rules?
No. Generally, they will use a combination of both 

### What is the importance of sets in counting? 

[[;2.1 - Sets]] can be used for many things in counting. 

We can use them to represent the objects we are counting from, and so the counted objects will be a subset of the set of all objects we are counting from.

Add to notion
- For counting, when you are reaching certain bounds, itâ€™s best to just test what happens as you approach those bounds 
- n! is always the way to rearrane n things 

Do some reserach on how things work with permuations and combinations
