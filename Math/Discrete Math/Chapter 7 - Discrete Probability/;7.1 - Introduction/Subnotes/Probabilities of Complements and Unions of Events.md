# Probabilities of Complements and Unions of Events

[[;7.1 - Introduction]]

## Notes

### What is the complement of an event? 

>[!info] Complement
>
>Let *E* be an event in sample space *S*. The probability of the event *E’* = *S* - *E*
>
>The complementary of event E is given by 
>p(*E’*) = 1 - p(*E*)

#### prove this:
Need to do an algebraic proof 
$p(\overline{E}) = \frac{|\overline{E}|}{|S|} = \frac{|S-E|}{|S|} = \frac{|S| - |E|}{|S|} = \frac{|S|}{|S|} - \frac{|E|}{|S|} = 1 - \frac{|E|}{|S|} = 1 - p(E)$

Hence

$p(\overline{E})=1-p(E)$


### How to find the probability of union of two events?
