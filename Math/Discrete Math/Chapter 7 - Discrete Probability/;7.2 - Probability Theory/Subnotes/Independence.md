Two events, E and F, are independent when the occurrence of one of the events gives no information about the other.

### What is the definition?

#### Derive it: 
p(E | F) = p(E and F) / p(F)   
If this is independent then this is just p(E)

so p(E and F) / p(F) = p(E)
p(E and F) = p(E) * p(F)

### What is pairwise and mutual independence.
