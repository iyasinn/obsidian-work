### What is the issue with Laplace’s definition of probability? 
Laplace’s definition, where:

Requires each outcome to be equally likely. Really this is the number of outcomes in an event divided by the total number of outcomes (the cardinality of the sample space)

However, some outcomes might be more weighted than other outcomes. 

Hence, this won’t always work. If we have a biased coin where there is a 3/4 chance to get heads, then according to this definition we just have 1/2 as the probability of getting heads, which is a contradiction and doesn’t work. 


This chapter will aim to solve these issues.
