## Notes

### What is a random variable?

>[!info] Random Variable
>
>A **random variable** is a function from the sample space of an experiment to the set of real numbers. That is, a random variable assigns a real number to each possible outcome. 
>
>So a random variable x can be defined as the following: 
>$x : s \to \mathbb{R}$
>
>So it takes in an outcome and produces a real number.

Note: A random variable is a function, not a variable.

### Explain notation for random variables
X(outcome) = real number

X = real number   is just saying that there is some outcome that can give this real number

P(X = real number) is the probability of getting that real number as an output for some number of inputs. 

### What is the distribution of a random variable?

X(S) is the set of all real numbers that we get from applying function random variable X to each outcome. Some outcomes may produce equivalent outcomes, but since we are talking about sets, this is accounted for. 

So r is all the real numbers 
And p(X = r) is the probability we get that r value.
