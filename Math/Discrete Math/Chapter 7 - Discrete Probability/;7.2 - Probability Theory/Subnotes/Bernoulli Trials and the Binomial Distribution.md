## Notes

### When is a Bernoulli trial used? What are the possible outcomes of a Bernoulli trial? 

A Bernoulli trial is used IFF there are only two possible outcomes for an experiment.

The possible outcomes are generally called a **success** or a **failure**

Most importantly: *p (success) + p (failure) = 1*

Generally, experiment or trial is a Bernoulli trial

### How can we solve problems with only a success or failure when needing k successes. 
We can determine probability of **k** successes occurring when an experiment consists of n mutually independent Bernoulli trials. 

A mutually independent Bernoulli trial is independent if the conditional probability of success of any given trial is p, given any information regarding the other trials (so the other trials do not affect the probabilities of each other in any way, shape, or form.)

### Prove the definition of finding k successes for n Bernoulli trials.

A function that can model a combination of Bernoulli trials.
