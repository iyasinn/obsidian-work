## Notes

### What is conditional probability?
It is the probability of one event E1 occurring given that another event E2 has already occurred.

### What is the formula for conditional probability? Conceptually, what is happening?

Conceptually, the original event is becoming our new sample space, and we are looking for the probability of our new event occurring under that original event. 


### Do we always need to use the conditional probability formula? 

No, we can just conceptually see that we have a new sample space, and find the probability under that new sample space.
