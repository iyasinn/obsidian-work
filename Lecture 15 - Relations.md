# Relations

Relations represent our knowledge of the world
They are more general types of functions


Functions map every input to **exactly one** output, while relations do not have that restriction. 

In a relation, an input can map to 0, 1, or more outputs. 
ANYTHING

A **binary** relation from A to B will contain many pairs, and any pair in that relation will be called a **related pair** 
It will be a subset of A x B

Coordinated pairs represent EDGES


We can represent relations through: 
- Graphs

- Through sets of ordered pairs 
	- R = {(Amira, 1), (Amira, 2), (Shruti, 2)}
- As a matrix with binary representation

- Describing the relation (with proportional logic). In english, logic, with R in the middle.  
	- You map to anyone you have talked to in the past 3 days.

R itself is just like funciton, some MAPPING that can be a mapping of any soorts, you can keep it informa.. 

Is a relation then just also known as
R = {(x, y) | R(x, y)}
Where R is the relation mapping

The set for an empty relation with no mapping will just be $\emptyset$, or the 0 matrix, or the predicate F (IMPROTANT WAY OF THINKING)




Relations have very interesting properties. 
Relations also need domain, codomain, and a mapping. 

### Reflexive 
Usually when domain = codomain 
xRx  EXISTS

It doesn’t need to be xRx for ALL mappings, instead, it JUST NEEDS to be the case that every element maps to itself. 

You can also just draw relations as one set, and draw arrows to see mapping **when** domain = codomain
And **arrows** = edge

### Symmetric










Can’t have symmetric and antisymmetric
Well, you can, for the empty set 


Empty set = symmetric, antisymmetric, and transitive

Set with max connections  = cartesian product = reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive.

For a nonempty set you can’t have a combination with reflexive or symmetric 


Can’t have a relation that has NO properteis

To not be transitive, we need a counter example edge, but to make a counter example edge, we will need to be either symmetric or antisymmetric. 

Hold up, we can make a ←→ b → c
This is not reflexive, not symmetric because a b→ c only and not asymmetric because a←→b

What if we say
Only one property allowed
Works for reflexive. 

Can’t be reflexive, symmetric, antisymmetric, AND 

---

Can’t be non transitive, symmetric, antisymmetric

And then you can or can’t have reflexive to get two combinations. 




For properties like reflexive, transitive….given some R relation that describes something, it DEPENDS
